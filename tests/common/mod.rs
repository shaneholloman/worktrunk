//! # Test Utilities for worktrunk
//!
//! This module provides test harnesses for testing the worktrunk CLI tool.
//!
//! ## TestRepo
//!
//! The `TestRepo` struct creates isolated git repositories in temporary directories
//! with deterministic timestamps and configuration. Each test gets a fresh repo
//! that is automatically cleaned up when the test ends.
//!
//! ## Fixture-Based Initialization
//!
//! To improve test performance, `TestRepo::new()` copies from a pre-initialized
//! template stored in `tests/fixtures/template-repo/`. The template contains a
//! `_git` directory (renamed from `.git` so it can be committed) which gets
//! copied and renamed to `.git` for each test. This avoids spawning `git init`
//! for every test, saving ~10ms per test.
//!
//! ## Environment Isolation
//!
//! Git commands are run with isolated environments using `Command::env()` to ensure:
//! - No interference from global git config
//! - Deterministic commit timestamps
//! - Consistent locale settings
//! - No cross-test contamination
//! - Thread-safe execution (no global state mutation)
//!
//! ## Path Canonicalization
//!
//! Paths are canonicalized to handle platform differences (especially macOS symlinks
//! like /var -> /private/var). This ensures snapshot filters work correctly.
//!
//! On Windows, `std::fs::canonicalize()` returns verbatim paths (`\\?\C:\...`) which
//! git cannot handle. We use `normalize_path()` to strip these prefixes while
//! preserving the symlink resolution behavior needed on macOS.
