Commit → Squash → Rebase → Pre-merge hooks → Push → Cleanup → Post-merge hooks

Commit: Uncommitted changes are staged and committed with LLM message.
Use --tracked-only to stage only tracked files.

Squash: Multiple commits are squashed into one with LLM message.
Skip with --no-squash. Safety backup: git reflog show refs/wt-backup/<branch>

Rebase: Branch is rebased onto target. Conflicts abort the merge immediately.

Hooks: Pre-merge commands run after rebase (failures abort). Post-merge commands
run after cleanup (failures logged). Skip all with --no-verify.

Push: Fast-forward push to local target branch. Non-fast-forward pushes are 
rejected.

Cleanup: Worktree and branch are removed. Skip with --no-remove.
