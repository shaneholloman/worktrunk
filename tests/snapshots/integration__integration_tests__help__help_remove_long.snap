Removes worktrees and their branches. Without arguments, removes the current worktree and returns to the main worktree.

[32mExamples

Remove current worktree:

  [2mwt remove

Remove specific worktrees:

  [2mwt remove feature-branch
  [2mwt remove old-feature another-branch

Keep the branch:

  [2mwt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

  [2mwt remove -D experimental

[32mBranch cleanup

Branches delete automatically when merging them would add nothing. This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but
file changes match.

Worktrunk checks five conditions (in order of cost):

1. [1mSame commit[0m — Branch HEAD equals the default branch. Shows [2m_[0m in [2mwt list[0m.
2. [1mAncestor[0m — Branch is in target's history (fast-forward or rebase case). Shows [2m⊂[0m.
3. [1mNo added changes[0m — Three-dot diff ([2mtarget...branch[0m) is empty. Shows [2m⊂[0m.
4. [1mTrees match[0m — Branch tree SHA equals target tree SHA. Shows [2m⊂[0m.
5. [1mMerge adds nothing[0m — Simulated merge produces the same tree as target. Handles squash-merged branches where target has advanced. Shows [2m⊂[0m.

Check 1 compares against the default branch. Checks 2-5 compare against [1mtarget[0m — the default branch, or its upstream (for example, [2morigin/main[0m)
when it's strictly ahead (catching branches merged remotely before pulling).

Branches showing [2m_[0m or [2m⊂[0m are dimmed as safe to delete.

Use [2m-D[0m to force-delete branches with unmerged changes. Use [2m--no-delete-branch[0m to keep the branch regardless of status.

[32mBackground removal

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m. Use [2m--no-background[0m to run
in the foreground.

[32mShortcuts

[2m@[0m (current), [2m-[0m (previous), [2m^[0m (default branch). See wt switch.
