wt remove - Remove worktree; delete branch if merged

For finished feature branches. Removes the current worktree by default.

[1m[32mArguments:
  [36m[BRANCHES]...
          Branch name [default: current]

[1m[32mOptions:
      [1m[36m--no-delete-branch
          Keep branch after removal

  [1m[36m-D[0m, [1m[36m--force-delete
          Delete unmerged branches

      [1m[36m--foreground
          Run removal in foreground (block until complete)

      [1m[36m--no-verify

          Remove worktrees even if they contain untracked files (like build artifacts). Without this flag, removal fails if untracked files exist.

[1m[32mExamples

Remove current worktree:

  [2mwt remove

Remove specific worktrees:

  [2mwt remove feature-branch
  [2mwt remove old-feature another-branch

Keep the branch:

  [2mwt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch

Force-delete an unmerged branch:

  [2mwt remove -D experimental

[1m[32mBranch cleanup

By default, branches are deleted when merging them would add nothing. This works with squash-merge and rebase workflows where commit history differs but file changes match.

Worktrunk checks five conditions (in order of cost):

1. [1mSame commit[0m — Branch HEAD equals the default branch. Shows [2m_[0m in [2mwt list[0m.
2. [1mAncestor[0m — Branch is in target's history (fast-forward or rebase case). Shows [2m⊂[0m.
3. [1mNo added changes[0m — Three-dot diff ([2mtarget...branch[0m) is empty. Shows [2m⊂[0m.
4. [1mTrees match[0m — Branch tree SHA equals target tree SHA. Shows [2m⊂[0m.
5. [1mMerge adds nothing[0m — Simulated merge produces the same tree as target. Handles squash-merged branches where target has advanced. Shows [2m⊂[0m.

The 'same commit' check uses the local default branch; for other checks, 'target' means the default branch, or its upstream (e.g., [2morigin/main[0m) when strictly ahead.

Branches showing [2m_[0m or [2m⊂[0m are dimmed as safe to delete.

[1m[32mForce flags

Worktrunk has two force flags for different situations:

          Flag          Scope                          When to use                         
   ─────────────────── ──────── ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
   --force (-f)        Worktree Worktree has untracked files (build artifacts, IDE config) 
   --force-delete (-D) Branch   Branch has unmerged commits                                

  [2mwt remove feature --force       # Remove worktree with untracked files
  [2mwt remove feature -D            # Delete unmerged branch
  [2mwt remove feature --force -D    # Both

Without [2m--force[0m, removal fails if the worktree contains untracked files. Without [2m-D[0m, removal keeps branches with unmerged changes. Use [2m--no-delete-branch[0m to keep the branch regardless of merge status.

[1m[32mBackground removal

Removal runs in the background by default (returns immediately). Logs are written to [2m.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log[0m. Use [2m--foreground[0m to run in the foreground.
