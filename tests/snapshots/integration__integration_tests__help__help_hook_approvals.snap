Project hooks require approval on first run to prevent untrusted projects from running arbitrary commands.

[1m[32mExamples

Pre-approve all commands for current project:
  [2mwt hook approvals add

Clear approvals for current project:
  [2mwt hook approvals clear

Clear global approvals:
  [2mwt hook approvals clear --global

[1m[32mHow approvals work

Approved commands are saved to user config. Re-approval is required when the command template changes or the project moves. Use [2m--yes[0m to bypass prompts in CI.
