Git worktree lifecycle automation, designed around running concurrent AI coding agents.

Git worktrees let multiple agents work on one repo without colliding; each gets
a separate directory. But creating worktrees, tracking paths, and cleaning up
afterward is manual. Worktrunk automates that lifecycle.

## What It Does

Automates the full lifecycle: create worktree, work, merge back, remove worktree.

<!-- Output generated from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_simple.snap (snapshot output includes [SHA]/[REPO]; replace with representative values when copying into README) -->
```bash
$ wt switch --create fix-auth
# Shell now in ../repo.fix-auth/

# Agent works, makes changes, then:
$ wt merge
🔄 Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no commit/squash/rebase needed)

   * a1b2c3d (HEAD -> fix-auth) Implement JWT validation
    auth.rs | 13 +++++++++++++
    1 file changed, 13 insertions(+)
✅ Merged to main (1 commit, 1 file, +13)
🔄 Removing worktree & branch...
✅ Removed worktree & branch for fix-auth, returned to primary at ../repo/
# Shell back in main
```

## Installation

```bash
cargo install worktrunk
wt config shell  # Sets up shell integration
```

## Three Commands

**Create workspace:**

```bash
wt switch --create feature-name
```

**Finish and merge:**

```bash
wt merge
```

**See active worktrees:**

```bash
wt list
```

## Automation Features

**LLM commits** - AI generates merge commits from diff and history:

```bash
wt merge
wt config help  # Setup guide
```

**Project hooks** - Auto-run tests, install deps:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[pre-merge-command]
"test" = "npm test"
```

**Shell integration** - Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell, PowerShell, Elvish, Xonsh, Oil.

## Design Philosophy

Worktrunk is opinionated. The choices optimize for AI agent workflows:

1. **Merge does everything** - Staging, committing all changes, merging, pushing, cleanup in one command
2. **Squash by default** - Linear history, configurable
3. **Automatic shell navigation** - No manual `cd` commands
4. **Fail-fast hooks** - Tests block bad merges

These trade manual control for automation. For fine-grained control, use `git worktree` directly.

## All Commands

- `wt switch [branch]` - Switch to existing worktree
- `wt switch --create [branch]` - Create and switch (supports `--base=@` to branch from current HEAD)
- `wt remove [branch]` - Remove worktree (use `@` for current)
- `wt merge [target]` - Merge, push, cleanup
- `wt list` - Show all worktrees
- `wt config` - Manage configuration

**Shortcut:** Use `@` to refer to your current HEAD (following git's convention):

```bash
wt switch @                              # Switch to current branch's worktree
wt switch --create new-feature --base=@  # Branch from current HEAD
wt remove @                              # Remove current worktree
```

See `wt --help` for details.

<details>
<summary>Status column symbols in <code>wt list</code></summary>

The Status column shows git repository state using compact symbols. Symbol order indicates priority: conflicts (blocking) → worktree state → git operations → branch divergence → working tree changes.

**Symbol order:** `= ≡∅ ↻⋈ ◇⊠⚠ ↑↓ ⇡⇣ ?!+»✘`

| Symbol | Meaning                                                                            | Category           | Dimmed? |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| `·`    | Branch without worktree                                                            | N/A                | No      |
| `=`    | Conflicts with main                                                                | Blocking           | No      |
| `≡`    | Working tree matches main (identical to main branch, regardless of commit history) | Worktree state     | Yes     |
| `∅`    | No commits (no commits ahead AND no uncommitted changes)                           | Worktree state     | Yes     |
| `↻`    | Rebase in progress                                                                 | Git operation      | No      |
| `⋈`    | Merge in progress                                                                  | Git operation      | No      |
| `◇`    | Bare worktree (no working directory)                                               | Worktree attribute | No      |
| `⊠`    | Locked worktree                                                                    | Worktree attribute | No      |
| `⚠`    | Prunable worktree                                                                  | Worktree attribute | No      |
| `↑`    | Commits ahead of main                                                              | Branch divergence  | No      |
| `↓`    | Commits behind main                                                                | Branch divergence  | No      |
| `⇡`    | Commits ahead of remote                                                            | Remote divergence  | No      |
| `⇣`    | Commits behind remote                                                              | Remote divergence  | No      |
| `?`    | Untracked files                                                                    | Working tree       | No      |
| `!`    | Modified files (unstaged)                                                          | Working tree       | No      |
| `+`    | Staged files                                                                       | Working tree       | No      |
| `»`    | Renamed files                                                                      | Working tree       | No      |
| `✘`    | Deleted files                                                                      | Working tree       | No      |

Symbols combine to show complete state (e.g., `≡↓!` means matches main, behind main, and has unstaged changes).

**Dimming logic:** **Dimmed rows** indicate worktrees with no marginal information beyond main (no unique work). Lines dim when they have either `≡` (matches main) OR `∅` (no commits). Both conditions use OR logic: either is sufficient to dim. This focuses attention on worktrees containing work.

**Branch-only entries:** Branches without worktrees show `·` in the Status column, indicating git status is not applicable (no working directory to check).

## Configuration

```bash
wt config list  # Show all config files and locations
wt config init  # Create global config with examples
wt config help  # Show LLM setup guide
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration details</summary>

Global config at `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
worktree-path = "../{main-worktree}.{branch}"

[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
args = ["-m", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]
```

Project config at `.config/wt.toml` in the repository root (see Project Automation above).

Worktree path defaults: `../repo.branch/` (siblings to main repo). Variables: `{main-worktree}`, `{branch}`, `{repo}`.

</details>

## Advanced Features

### LLM-Powered Commit Messages

During merge operations, worktrunk can generate commit messages using an LLM. The LLM analyzes the staged diff and recent commit history to write messages matching the project's style.

```bash
# Merge with LLM-generated commit message (squashes by default)
$ wt merge

# Merge without squashing commits
$ wt merge --no-squash

# Merge to a specific target branch
$ wt merge staging
```

Set up LLM integration: `wt config help` shows the setup guide, `wt config init` creates example config.

<details>
<summary>Manual configuration</summary>

Edit `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"  # or "claude", "gpt", etc.
args = ["-m", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]
```

If the LLM is unavailable or fails, worktrunk falls back to a deterministic message.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Advanced: Custom Prompt Templates</b></summary>

Worktrunk uses [minijinja templates](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/syntax/index.html) for commit message prompts, giving you full control over what the LLM sees.

**Inline template for normal commits:**

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
args = ["-s"]
template = """
Generate a commit message for {{ repo | upper }}.

Branch: {{ branch }}
{%- if recent_commits %}

Recent commit style ({{ recent_commits | length }} commits):
{%- for commit in recent_commits %}
  {{ loop.index }}. {{ commit }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endif %}

Changes to commit:
```

{{ git_diff }}

```

Requirements:
- Follow the style of recent commits above
- First line under 50 chars
- Focus on WHY, not HOW
"""
```

**Inline template for squash commits:**

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
squash-template = """
Squashing {{ commits | length }} commit(s) from {{ branch }} to {{ target_branch }}.

{% if commits | length > 1 -%}
Commits being combined:
{%- for c in commits %}
  {{ loop.index }}/{{ loop.length }}: {{ c }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- else -%}
Single commit: {{ commits[0] }}
{%- endif %}

Generate one cohesive commit message that captures the overall change.
Use conventional commit format (feat/fix/docs/refactor).
"""
```

**External template files:**

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "claude"
template-file = "~/.config/worktrunk/commit-template.jinja"
squash-template-file = "~/.config/worktrunk/squash-template.jinja"
```

**Available template variables:**

Normal commits:

- `{{ git_diff }}` - Staged changes
- `{{ branch }}` - Current branch name
- `{{ recent_commits }}` - Array of recent commit messages (for style matching)
- `{{ repo }}` - Repository name

Squash commits:

- `{{ commits }}` - Array of commit messages being squashed
- `{{ target_branch }}` - Branch being merged into (e.g., "main")
- `{{ branch }}` - Current branch name
- `{{ repo }}` - Repository name

See the [minijinja template documentation](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/syntax/index.html) for complete syntax reference (filters, conditionals, loops, whitespace control, etc.).

</details>

### Project Automation

Automate common tasks by creating `.config/wt.toml` in your repository root. Run tests before merging, install dependencies when creating worktrees, start dev servers automatically.

```toml
# Install deps when creating a worktree
[post-create-command]
"install" = "npm install --frozen-lockfile"

# Start dev server automatically
[post-start-command]
"dev" = "npm run dev"

# Run tests before merging
[pre-merge-command]
"test" = "npm test"
"lint" = "npm run lint"
```

<details>
<summary>All available hooks</summary>

| Hook                    | When It Runs                                                                   | Execution                                     | Failure Behavior                                |

| **pre-merge-command**   | After rebase completes during `wt merge` (validates rebased state before push) | Sequential, blocking, fail-fast               | Terminates merge immediately                    |
| **post-merge-command**  | After successful merge and push to target branch, before cleanup               | Sequential, blocking                          | Logs warning, continues with remaining commands |

**Template variables:** `{repo}`, `{branch}`, `{worktree}`, `{repo_root}`, `{target}`

**Skipping hooks:** `wt switch --no-verify` or `wt merge --no-verify`

**Security:** Commands require approval on first run. Use `--force` to bypass.

**Example output with hooks:**

### Custom Worktree Status

Add emoji status markers to worktrees that appear in `wt list`. Perfect for tracking work-in-progress states, CI status, or team coordination.

**Set status manually:**

```bash
# Set an emoji status for a branch (works everywhere)
git config worktrunk.status.feature-x "🚧"

# Clear the status
git config --unset worktrunk.status.feature-x
```

**Status appears in the Status column:**

```
Branch     Status      Working ±  Main ↕  Path
feature-a  ≡↓!🚧                  ↓2      ./feature-a/
feature-b  ↑!✅        +2 -1     ↑1      ./feature-b/
feature-c  🤖                            ./feature-c/
```

The custom emoji appears directly after the git status symbols.

<details>
<summary><b>Automation with Claude Code Hooks</b></summary>

Claude Code can automatically set/clear emoji status when coding sessions start and end. This shows which branches have active AI sessions.

**Easy setup:** Install the Worktrunk Claude Code plugin which includes these hooks automatically:

<!-- [Worktrunk Claude Code plugin](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk) -->

```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces
git clone https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk.git worktrunk-skills
```

**Manual setup:** Alternatively, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} git config worktrunk.status.{} 🤖"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} git config worktrunk.status.{} 💬"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null | xargs -I {} git config --unset worktrunk.status.{} 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Now when you use Claude:

- Sets status to `🤖` for the current branch when you submit a prompt (working)
- Changes to `💬` when Claude returns a response (ready for your input)
- Clears the status completely when the session ends

**Status from other terminal:**

```bash
# While Claude is working
$ wt list
Branch     Status      Working ±  Path
main                              ./myapp/
feature-x  ↑!🤖        +5 -2     ./myapp.feature-x/

# After Claude responds (waiting for your input)
$ wt list
Branch     Status      Working ±  Path
main                              ./myapp/
feature-x  ↑!💬        +5 -2     ./myapp.feature-x/
```

**How it works:**

- Status is stored as `worktrunk.status.<branch>` in `.git/config`
- Each branch can have its own status emoji
- The hooks automatically detect the current branch and set/clear its status
- Status is shared across all worktrees on the same branch (by design)
- Works with any git repository, no special configuration needed

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: Per-Worktree Status (Advanced)</b></summary>

For true per-worktree isolation (different status for multiple worktrees on the same branch), use worktree-specific config:

**One-time setup (enables per-worktree config for the repo):**

```bash
git config extensions.worktreeConfig true
```

**Set status from within a worktree:**

```bash
# From within the worktree
git config --worktree worktrunk.status "🚧"

# Clear status
git config --worktree --unset worktrunk.status
```

**Claude Code hooks for per-worktree:**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 && git config extensions.worktreeConfig true 2>/dev/null; git config --worktree worktrunk.status 🤖 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "git config --worktree --unset worktrunk.status 2>/dev/null || true"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Priority:** Worktree-specific config takes precedence over branch-keyed config when both exist.

</details>

</details>

### Worktree Paths

By default, worktrees live as siblings to the main repo:

```
myapp/               # primary worktree
myapp.feature-x/     # secondary worktree
myapp.bugfix-y/      # secondary worktree
```

Customize the pattern in `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
# Inside the repo (keeps everything contained)
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{branch}"

# Shared directory with multiple repos
worktree-path = "../worktrees/{main-worktree}/{branch}"
```

### Shell Integration Details

Worktrunk automatically configures your shell:

```bash
wt config shell
```

This adds shell integration to your config files (supports Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell, PowerShell, Elvish, Xonsh, Oil). The integration enables `wt switch` to change directories and `wt remove` to return to the previous location.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if you prefer)</summary>

Add one line to your shell config:

**Bash** (`~/.bashrc`):

```bash
eval "$(wt init bash)"
```

**Fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`):

```fish
wt init fish | source
```

**Zsh** (`~/.zshrc`):

```bash
eval "$(wt init zsh)"
```

**Nushell** (`~/.config/nushell/env.nu`):

```nu
wt init nushell | save -f ~/.cache/wt-init.nu
```

Then add to `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`:

```nu
source ~/.cache/wt-init.nu
```

**PowerShell** (profile):

```powershell
wt init powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

**Elvish** (`~/.config/elvish/rc.elv`):

```elvish
eval (wt init elvish | slurp)
```

**Xonsh** (`~/.xonshrc`):

```python
execx($(wt init xonsh))
```

**Oil Shell** (`~/.config/oil/oshrc`):

```bash
eval "$(wt init oil)"
```

</details>

## Status

Worktrunk is in active development. The core features are stable and ready for use. While the project is pre-1.0, the CLI interface and major features are unlikely to change significantly.

<details>
<summary><b>Developing</b></summary>

### Releases

Use [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) to publish new versions:

```bash
cargo install cargo-release

# Bump version, update Cargo.lock, commit, tag, and push
cargo release patch --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
cargo release minor --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
cargo release major --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
```

This updates Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock, creates a commit and tag, then pushes to GitHub. The tag push triggers GitHub Actions to build binaries, create the release, and publish to crates.io.

Run without `--execute` to preview changes first.

## FAQ

### Installation fails with C compilation errors

If you encounter errors related to tree-sitter or C compilation (like "error: 'for' loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode" or "undefined reference to le16toh"), install without syntax highlighting:

```bash
cargo install worktrunk --no-default-features
```

This disables bash syntax highlighting in command output but keeps all core functionality. The syntax highlighting feature requires C99 compiler support and can fail on older systems or minimal Docker images.
