> **December 2025**: I've been using Worktrunk as my daily driver, and am releasing it as Open Source this week. It's built with love (there's no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), & [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg).

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for parallel AI agent workflows. Git worktrees give each agent an isolated branch and directory; Worktrunk adds branch-based navigation, unified status, and lifecycle hooks. Creating a new agent workspace is as immediate as `git switch`.

## Git worktrees

AI agents like Claude and Codex can increasingly handle longer tasks without supervision. Running several in parallel is practical. But on a single checkout they step on each other's uncommitted changes.

Git worktrees solve this: multiple working directories sharing one `.git`.

But the built-in commands are path-oriented: `git worktree add -b feature ../repo.feature`, then `cd ../repo.feature`, then `git worktree remove ../repo.feature`.

## What Worktrunk adds

Worktrunk makes worktrees easy to use — branch-based navigation, unified status, and workflow automation:

| Task | Worktrunk | Plain git |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Switch worktrees | `wt switch feature` | `cd ../repo.feature` |
| Create + start Claude | `wt switch -c -x claude feature` | `git worktree add -b feature ../repo.feature && cd ../repo.feature && claude` |
| Clean up | `wt remove` | `cd ../repo && git worktree remove ../repo.feature && git branch -d feature` |
| List with status | `wt list` | `git worktree list` (paths only) |

- **[Lifecycle hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hooks/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command

## In practice

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_simple_switch.snap — edit source to update -->

```bash
$ wt switch --create fix-auth
✅ Created new worktree for fix-auth from main at ../repo.fix-auth
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

This creates `../repo.fix-auth` on branch `fix-auth`.

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_switch_back.snap — edit source to update -->

```bash
$ wt switch feature-api
✅ Switched to worktree for feature-api at ../repo.feature-api
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__list__readme_example_list.snap — edit source to update -->

```console
$ wt list

The `--full` flag adds CI status and conflict detection.

Clean up when done:

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_remove.snap — edit source to update -->

```bash
$ wt remove
🔄 Removing feature-api worktree & branch in background (already in main)
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**

```bash
$ brew install max-sixty/worktrunk/wt
$ wt config shell install  # allows commands to change directories
```

**Cargo:**

```bash
$ cargo install worktrunk
$ wt config shell install
```
