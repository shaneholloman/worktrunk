Worktrunk is a CLI for Git worktree management, designed for parallel AI agent workflows. Worktrees give each agent an isolated branch and directory; Worktrunk adds branch-based navigation, lifecycle hooks, and unified status. The goal is to make spinning up a new AI "developer" for a task feel as routine as `git switch`.

## Demo

![Worktrunk Demo](dev/wt-demo/out/wt-demo.gif)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```console
$ cargo install worktrunk
$ wt config shell install  # allows commands to change directories
```

### 2. Create a worktree

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_simple_switch.snap — edit source to update -->

```console
$ wt switch --create fix-auth
✅ Created new worktree for fix-auth from main at ../repo.fix-auth
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

This creates `../repo.fix-auth` on branch `fix-auth`.

### 3. Merge it

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_simple.snap — edit source to update -->

```console
$ wt merge
🔄 Merging 1 commit to main @ d29e0fd (no commit/squash/rebase needed)
   * d29e0fd Implement JWT validation
    auth.rs | 13 +++++++++++++
    1 file changed, 13 insertions(+)
✅ Merged to main (1 commit, 1 file, +13)
🔄 Removing fix-auth worktree & branch in background
```

<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

`wt merge` handles the full workflow: stage, commit, squash, rebase, run hooks,
merge, cleanup.

### 4. List worktrees

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__list__readme_example_simple_list.snap — edit source to update -->

```console
$ wt list
  Branch     Status         HEAD±    main↕  Path              Remote⇅  Commit    Age   Message
@ main           ^∥                         ./repo               ∥     b834638e  1d    Initial commit

`--full` adds CI status and conflicts. `--branches` includes all branches.

## Why worktrees?

Parallel agents need isolated working directories that share one Git history.

We can get that a few ways:

- multiple clones — slow to set up, waste disk, drift out of sync
- one working tree with many branches — constant stashing, rebasing, and conflict risk
- git worktrees — multiple directories backed by a single `.git` directory

So we use git worktrees: multiple working directories backed by a single repository.

## Why Worktrunk?

Git's built-in `worktree` commands give you the primitives but not the lifecycle. Worktrunk bundles creation, hooks, merging, and cleanup into three commands: `wt switch`, `wt merge`, and `wt list`. A few examples:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Task</th>
<th>Worktrunk</th>
<th>Plain git</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Create + start Claude</td>
<td><pre lang="bash">wt switch -c feature -x claude</pre></td>
<td><pre lang="bash">git worktree add -b feature ../repo.feature main
cd ../repo.feature && claude</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Merge + clean up</td>
<td><pre lang="bash">wt merge</pre></td>
<td><pre lang="bash">cd ../repo && git merge feature
git worktree remove ../repo.feature
git branch -d feature</pre></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full workflow</td>
<td><pre lang="bash"># after configuring hooks
wt merge</pre></td>
<td><pre lang="bash">git add -A
git reset --soft $(git merge-base HEAD main)
# commit-generation
git diff --staged | llm "msg" | git commit -F -
git rebase main
# pre-merge hook
cargo test
cd ../repo && git merge --ff-only feature
git worktree remove ../repo.feature
git branch -d feature
# post-merge hook
cargo install --path .</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Automation

### LLM commit messages

Worktrunk can invoke external commands to generate commit messages.
[llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) is recommended.

`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
args = ["-m", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]
```

`wt merge` generates commit messages automatically:

### Project hooks

Configure hooks in `.config/wt.toml`:

| Hook            | When                                | Example                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **post-create** | After worktree created              | `cp -r .cache`, `ln -s`      |
| **post-start**  | After worktree created (background) | `npm install`, `cargo build` |
| **pre-commit**  | Before squash commit created        | `pre-commit run`             |
| **pre-merge**   | After squash, before push           | `cargo test`, `pytest`       |
| **post-merge**  | After successful merge              | `cargo install --path .`     |

```toml
# Install dependencies, build setup

### Shell integration

Shell integration lets `wt switch`, `wt merge`, and `wt remove` change
directories:

```console
wt config shell install  # Bash, Zsh, Fish
```

Manual setup: `wt config shell --help`.

## Tips & patterns

**Alias for new worktree + agent:**

```console
alias wsl='wt switch --create --execute=claude'
wsl new-feature  # Creates worktree, runs hooks, launches Claude
```

**Eliminate cold starts** — `post-create` hooks install deps and copy caches.
See [`.config/wt.toml`](.config/wt.toml) for an example using copy-on-write.

**Local CI gate** — `pre-merge` hooks run before merging. Failures abort the
merge.

**Track agent status** — Custom emoji markers show agent state in `wt list`.
Claude Code hooks can set these automatically. See [Custom Worktree
Status](#custom-worktree-status).

**Monitor CI across branches** — `wt list --full --branches` shows PR/CI status
for all branches, including those without worktrees. CI column links to PR pages
in terminals with hyperlink support.

**JSON API** — `wt list --format=json` for dashboards, statuslines, scripts.

**Task runners** — Reference Taskfile/Justfile/Makefile in hooks:

```toml
[post-create]
"setup" = "task install"

[pre-merge]
"validate" = "just test lint"
```

**Shortcuts** — `^` = default branch, `@` = current branch, `-` = previous
worktree. Example: `wt switch --create hotfix --base=@` branches from current
HEAD.

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from `wt switch --help-md` — edit source to update -->

```text
wt switch — Switch to a worktree
Usage: wt switch [OPTIONS] <BRANCH>

Arguments:
  <BRANCH>
          Branch, path, '@' (HEAD), '-' (previous), or '^' (main)

Options:
  -c, --create
          Create a new branch

  -b, --base <BASE>
          Base branch

          Defaults to default branch.

  -x, --execute <EXECUTE>
          Command to run after switch

  -f, --force
          Skip approval prompts

      --no-verify
          Skip all project hooks

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

  -v, --verbose
          Show commands and debug info

```

## Operation

### Worktree resolution

Arguments are resolved using **path-first lookup**:

1. Compute the expected path for the argument (using the configured path template)
2. If a worktree exists at that path, switch to it (regardless of what branch it's on)
3. Otherwise, treat the argument as a branch name

**Example**: If `repo.foo/` exists but is on branch `bar`:
- `wt switch foo` switches to `repo.foo/` (the `bar` branch worktree)
- `wt switch bar` also works (falls back to branch lookup)

### Switching to Existing Worktree

- If worktree exists at expected path or for branch, changes directory via shell integration
- No hooks run
- No branch creation

### Creating New Worktree (`--create`)

1. Creates new branch (defaults to current default branch as base)
2. Creates worktree in configured location (default: `../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }}`)
3. Runs post-create hooks sequentially (blocking)
4. Shows success message
5. Spawns post-start hooks in background (non-blocking)
6. Changes directory to new worktree via shell integration

## Hooks

### post-create (sequential, blocking)

- Run after worktree creation, before success message
- Typically: `npm install`, `cargo build`, setup tasks
- Failures block the operation
- Skip with `--no-verify`

### post-start (parallel, background)

- Spawned after success message shown
- Typically: dev servers, file watchers, editors
- Run in background, failures logged but don't block
- Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-post-start-{name}.log`
- Skip with `--no-verify`

**Template variables:** `{{ repo }}`, `{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, `{{ repo_root }}`

**Security:** Commands from project hooks require approval on first run.
Approvals are saved to user config. Use `--force` to bypass prompts.
See `wt config approvals --help`.

## Examples

Switch to existing worktree:

```console
wt switch feature-branch
```

Create new worktree from main:

```console
wt switch --create new-feature
```

Switch to previous worktree:

```console
wt switch -
```

Create from specific base:

```console
wt switch --create hotfix --base production
```

Create and run command:

```console
wt switch --create docs --execute "code ."
```

Skip hooks during creation:

```console
wt switch --create temp --no-verify
```

## Shortcuts

Use `@` for current HEAD, `-` for previous, `^` for main:

```console
wt switch @                              # Switch to current branch's worktree
wt switch -                              # Switch to previous worktree
wt switch --create new-feature --base=^  # Branch from main (default)
wt switch --create bugfix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD
wt remove @                              # Remove current worktree
```

wt merge — Merge worktree into target branch
Usage: wt merge [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Arguments:
  [TARGET]

          Defaults to default branch.

Options:
      --no-squash
          Skip commit squashing

      --no-commit
          Skip commit, squash, and rebase

          Possible values:
          - all:     Stage everything: untracked files + unstaged tracked changes
          - tracked: Stage tracked changes only (like git add -u)
          - none:    Stage nothing, commit only what's already in the index

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -v, --verbose
          Show commands and debug info

```

## Operation

Commit → Squash → Rebase → Pre-merge hooks → Push → Cleanup → Post-merge hooks

### Commit

Uncommitted changes are staged and committed with LLM commit message.
Use `--stage=tracked` to stage only tracked files, or `--stage=none` to commit only what's already staged.

### Squash

Multiple commits are squashed into one (like GitHub's "Squash and merge") with LLM commit message.
Skip with `--no-squash`. Safety backup: `git reflog show refs/wt-backup/<branch>`

### Rebase

Branch is rebased onto target. Conflicts abort the merge immediately.

### Hooks

Pre-merge commands run after rebase (failures abort). Post-merge commands
run after cleanup (failures logged). Skip all with `--no-verify`.

### Push

Fast-forward push to local target branch. Non-fast-forward pushes are rejected.

### Cleanup

Worktree and branch are removed. Skip with `--no-remove`.

**Template variables:** `{{ repo }}`, `{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, `{{ repo_root }}`, `{{ target }}`

**Security:** Commands from project hooks require approval on first run.
Approvals are saved to user config. Use `--force` to bypass prompts.
See `wt config approvals --help`.

## Examples

Basic merge to main:

```console
wt merge
```

Merge without squashing:

```console
wt merge --no-squash

Options:
      --no-delete-branch
          Keep branch after removal

  -v, --verbose
          Show commands and debug info

```

## Operation

Removes worktree directory, git metadata, and branch. Requires clean working tree.

### No arguments (remove current)

- Removes current worktree and switches to main worktree
- In main worktree: switches to default branch

### By name (remove specific)

- Removes specified worktree(s) and branches
- Current worktree removed last (switches to main first)

### Worktree resolution

Arguments are resolved to worktrees using **path-first lookup**:

1. Compute the expected path for the argument (using the configured path template)
2. If a worktree exists at that path, use it (regardless of what branch it's on)
3. Otherwise, treat the argument as a branch name

**Example**: If `repo.foo/` exists but is on branch `bar`:
- `wt remove foo` removes `repo.foo/` and the `bar` branch
- `wt remove bar` also works (falls back to branch lookup)

**Conflict detection**: If path `repo.foo/` has a worktree on branch `bar`, but
branch `foo` has a different worktree at `repo.bar/`, an error is raised.

**Special arguments**:

- `@` - current worktree (by path, works in detached HEAD)
- `-` - previous worktree (from switch history)
- `^` - main/default branch worktree

### Branch deletion

By default, branches are deleted only when their content has been integrated:

- Traditional merge: branch is an ancestor of the target (git's `-d` behavior)
- Squash merge/rebase: branch's tree SHA matches target's tree SHA

This handles workflows where PRs are squash-merged or rebased, which don't preserve
commit ancestry but do integrate the content. Use `-D` to delete unintegrated
branches, or `--no-delete-branch` to always keep branches.

### Background removal (default)

- Returns immediately for continued work
- Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log`
- Use `--no-background` for foreground (blocking)

### Cleanup

Stops any git fsmonitor daemon for the worktree before removal. This prevents orphaned processes when using builtin fsmonitor (`core.fsmonitor=true`). No effect on Watchman users.

## Examples

Remove current worktree and branch:

```console
wt remove
```

Remove specific worktree and branch:

```console
wt remove feature-branch
```

Remove worktree but keep branch:

```console
wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch
```

Remove multiple worktrees:

```console
wt remove old-feature another-branch
```

Remove in foreground (blocking):

```console
wt remove --no-background feature-branch
```

Switch to default in main:

```console
wt remove  # (when already in main worktree)
```

Use `--format=json` for structured data. Each object contains two status maps
with the same fields in the same order as Status Symbols above:

**`status`** - variant names for querying:

- `working_tree`: `{untracked, modified, staged, renamed, deleted}` booleans
- `branch_state`: `""` | `"Conflicts"` | `"MergeTreeConflicts"` | `"MatchesMain"` | `"NoCommits"`
- `git_operation`: `""` | `"Rebase"` | `"Merge"`
- `main_divergence`: `""` | `"Ahead"` | `"Behind"` | `"Diverged"`
- `upstream_divergence`: `""` | `"Ahead"` | `"Behind"` | `"Diverged"`
- `user_status`: string (optional)

**`status_symbols`** - Unicode symbols for display (same fields, plus `worktree_attrs`: ⎇/⌫/⊠)

Note: `locked` and `prunable` are top-level fields on worktree objects, not in status.

**Worktree position fields** (for identifying special worktrees):

- `is_main`: boolean - is the main/default worktree
- `is_current`: boolean - is the current working directory (present when true)
- `is_previous`: boolean - is the previous worktree from `wt switch` (present when true)

**Query examples:**

```console
# Find worktrees with conflicts
jq '.[] | select(.status.branch_state == "Conflicts")'

# Find worktrees with untracked files
jq '.[] | select(.status.working_tree.untracked)'

# Find worktrees in rebase or merge
jq '.[] | select(.status.git_operation != "")'

# Get branches ahead of main
jq '.[] | select(.status.main_divergence == "Ahead")'

# Find locked worktrees
jq '.[] | select(.locked != null)'

# Get current worktree info (useful for statusline tools)
jq '.[] | select(.is_current == true)'
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Worktree Status

Add emoji status markers to branches that appear in `wt list`.

```console
# Set status for current branch
wt config status set "🤖"

# Or use git config directly
git config worktrunk.status.feature-x "💬"
```

**Status appears in the Status column:**

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__list__with_user_status.snap — edit source to update -->

The custom emoji appears directly after the git status symbols.

<details>
<summary>Automation with Claude Code Hooks</summary>

Claude Code can automatically set/clear emoji status when coding sessions start and end.

When using Claude:

- Sets status to `🤖` for the current branch when submitting a prompt (working)
- Changes to `💬` when Claude needs input (waiting for permission or idle)
- Clears the status completely when the session ends

**How it works:**

- Status is stored as `worktrunk.status.<branch>` in `.git/config`
- Each branch can have its own status emoji
- The hooks automatically detect the current branch and set/clear its status
- Works with any git repository, no special configuration needed

</details>

### `wt beta select`

Interactive worktree selector with fuzzy search and diff preview. Unix only.

Preview tabs (toggle with `1`/`2`/`3`):

- **Tab 1**: Working tree changes (uncommitted)
- **Tab 2**: History (commits not on main highlighted)
- **Tab 3**: Branch diff (changes ahead of main)

### `wt beta statusline`

Single-line status for shell prompts, starship, or editor integrations.

**Claude Code integration** (`--claude-code`): Reads workspace context from
stdin, outputs directory, branch status, and model name.

```

## Project Status

Worktrunk is in active development. The core features are stable and ready for
use. There may be backward-incompatible changes.

The most helpful way to contribute:

- Use it!
- Star the repo / tell friends / post about it
- Find bugs, file reproducible bug reports

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What commands does Worktrunk execute?</strong></summary>

Worktrunk executes commands in three contexts:

1. **Project hooks** (`.config/wt.toml`) - Automation for worktree lifecycle
2. **LLM commands** (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) - Commit message generation
3. **--execute flag** - Commands provided explicitly

Commands from project hooks and LLM configuration require approval on first run. Approved commands are saved to `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` under the project's configuration. If a command changes, Worktrunk requires new approval.

**Example approval prompt:**

<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_approval_prompt.snap — edit source to update -->

```
🟡 repo needs approval to execute 3 commands:

⚪ post-create install:
   echo 'Installing dependencies...'

⚪ post-create build:
   echo 'Building project...'

⚪ post-create test:
   echo 'Running tests...'

<details>
<summary><strong>How does Worktrunk compare to alternatives?</strong></summary>

### vs. Branch Switching

Branch switching uses one directory, so only one agent can work at a time.
Worktrees give each agent its own directory.

### vs. Plain `git worktree`

Git's built-in worktree commands work but require manual lifecycle management:

```console
# Plain git worktree workflow
git worktree add -b feature-branch ../myapp-feature main
cd ../myapp-feature
# ...work, commit, push...
cd ../myapp
git merge feature-branch
git worktree remove ../myapp-feature
git branch -d feature-branch
```

Worktrunk automates the full lifecycle:

```console
wt switch --create feature-branch  # Creates worktree, runs setup hooks
# ...work...
wt merge                            # Squashes, merges, removes worktree
```

What `git worktree` doesn't provide:

- Consistent directory naming and cleanup validation
- Project-specific automation (install dependencies, start services)
- Unified status across all worktrees (commits, CI, conflicts, changes)

Worktrunk adds path management, lifecycle hooks, and `wt list --full` for viewing all worktrees—branches, uncommitted changes, commits ahead/behind, CI status, and conflicts—in a single view.

### vs. git-machete / git-town

Different scopes:

- **git-machete**: Branch stack management in a single directory
- **git-town**: Git workflow automation in a single directory
- **worktrunk**: Multi-worktree management with hooks and status aggregation

These tools can be used together—run git-machete or git-town inside individual worktrees.

### vs. Git TUIs (lazygit, gh-dash, etc.)

Git TUIs operate on a single repository. Worktrunk manages multiple worktrees,
runs automation hooks, and aggregates status across branches. TUIs work inside
each worktree directory.

<details>
<summary><strong>Installation fails with C compilation errors</strong></summary>

Errors related to tree-sitter or C compilation (C99 mode, `le16toh` undefined)
can be avoided by installing without syntax highlighting:

```console
cargo install worktrunk --no-default-features
```

This disables bash syntax highlighting in command output but keeps all core functionality. The syntax highlighting feature requires C99 compiler support and can fail on older systems or minimal Docker images.

<summary><strong>Any notes for developing this crate?</strong></summary>

### Running Tests

**Quick tests (no external dependencies):**

```bash
cargo test --lib --bins           # Unit tests (~200 tests)
cargo test --test integration     # Integration tests without shell tests (~300 tests)
```

**Full integration tests (requires bash, zsh, fish):**

```bash
cargo test --test integration --features shell-integration-tests
```

**Dependencies for shell integration tests:**

- bash, zsh, fish shells
- Quick setup: `./dev/setup-claude-code-web.sh` (installs shells on Linux)

### Releases

Use [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) to publish new versions:

```console
cargo install cargo-release

# Bump version, update Cargo.lock, commit, tag, and push
cargo release patch --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
cargo release minor --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
cargo release major --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
```

This updates Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock, creates a commit and tag, then pushes to GitHub. The tag push triggers GitHub Actions to build binaries, create the release, and publish to crates.io.

Run without `--execute` to preview changes first.
