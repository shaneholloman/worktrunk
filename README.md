> **December 2025**: I've been using Worktrunk as my daily driver, and am releasing it as Open Source this week; I think folks will find it really helpful. It's built with love (there's no slop!). If social proof is helpful: I also created [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql) (10k stars) and am a maintainer of [Xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) (4k stars), [Insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta), & [Numbagg](https://github.com/numbagg/numbagg).

Worktrunk is a CLI for git worktree management, designed for running AI agents in parallel.

Worktrunk's three core commands make worktrees as easy as branches. Plus, Worktrunk has a bunch of quality-of-life features to simplify working with many parallel changes, including hooks to automate local workflows.

Scaling agents becomes trivial. Here's a quick demo:

## Context: git worktrees

AI agents like Claude Code and Codex can handle longer tasks without
supervision, such that it's possible to manage 5-10+ in parallel. Git's native
worktree feature give each agent its own working directory, so they don't step
on each other's changes.

But the git worktree UX is clunky. Even a task as small as starting a new
worktree requires typing the branch name three times: `git worktree add -b feat
../repo.feat`, then `cd ../repo.feat`.

## Worktrunk makes git worktrees as easy as branches

> Start with the core commands

**Core commands:**

<table class="cmd-compare">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Task</th>
      <th>Worktrunk</th>
      <th>Plain git</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Switch worktrees</td>
      <td><pre>wt switch feat</pre></td>
      <td><pre>cd ../repo.feat</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create + start Claude</td>
      <td><pre>wt switch -c -x claude feat</pre></td>
      <td><pre>git worktree add -b feat ../repo.feat && \
cd ../repo.feat && \
claude</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Clean up</td>
      <td><pre>wt remove</pre></td>
      <td><pre>cd ../repo && \
git worktree remove ../repo.feat && \
git branch -d feat</pre></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>List with status</td>
      <td><pre>wt list</pre></td>
      <td><pre>git worktree list</pre> (paths only)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Workflow automation:**

> Expand into the more advanced commands as needed

- **[Hooks](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/)** — run commands on create, pre-merge, post-merge, etc
- **[LLM commit messages](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/)** — generate commit messages from diffs via [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/)
- **[Merge workflow](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/)** — squash, rebase, merge, clean up in one command
- ...and **[lots more](#next-steps)**

Here's a demo with some of the more advanced features:

**Homebrew (macOS & Linux):**

```bash
$ brew install max-sixty/worktrunk/wt
$ wt config shell install
```

Shell integration allows commands to change directories.

**Cargo:**

```bash
$ cargo install worktrunk
$ wt config shell install
```
