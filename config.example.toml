# Worktrunk Global Configuration
# Location (XDG Base Directory spec):
#   macOS/Linux:   ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/worktrunk/config.toml)
#   Windows:       %APPDATA%\worktrunk\config.toml
#
# Generate with: wt config init

# Worktree Path Template
# Variables: {repo} = repository name, {branch} = branch name
# Branch slashes are replaced with dashes (feature/auth → feature-auth)
# Paths are relative to the main worktree root (original repository directory)
worktree-path = "../{repo}.{branch}"

# Alternative: Keep worktrees inside repo (useful for bare repos)
# worktree-path = ".worktrees/{branch}"

# Alternative: Shared directory for multiple repos
# worktree-path = "../worktrees/{repo}/{branch}"

# LLM Integration (Optional)
# For generating commit messages during merge operations (wt merge)
