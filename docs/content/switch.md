Switches to a worktree, creating one if needed. Creating a worktree runs [hooks](@/hook.md).

## Examples

```bash
wt switch feature-auth           # Switch to worktree
wt switch -                      # Previous worktree (like cd -)
wt switch --create new-feature   # Create new branch and worktree
wt switch --create hotfix --base production
```

For interactive selection, use [`wt select`](@/select.md).

## Creating worktrees

When the target branch has no worktree, worktrunk:

1. Creates worktree at configured path
2. Runs [post-create hooks](@/hook.md#post-create) (blocking)
3. Switches to new directory
4. Spawns [post-start hooks](@/hook.md#post-start) (background)

The `--create` flag creates a new branch from `--base` (defaults to default branch). Without `--create`, the branch must already exist.

```bash
wt switch feature                        # Existing branch → creates worktree
wt switch --create feature               # New branch and worktree
wt switch --create fix --base release    # New branch from release
wt switch --create temp --no-verify      # Skip hooks
```

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `^` | Default branch (main/master) |
| `@` | Current branch/worktree |
| `-` | Previous worktree (like `cd -`) |

```bash
wt switch -                      # Back to previous
wt switch ^                      # Main worktree
wt switch --create fix --base=@  # Branch from current HEAD
```

## Argument resolution

Arguments resolve by checking the filesystem before git branches:

1. Compute expected path from argument (using configured path template)
2. If worktree exists at that path, switch to it
3. Otherwise, look up as branch name

If the path and branch resolve to different worktrees (e.g., `repo.foo/` tracks branch `bar`), the path takes precedence.

## Command reference

```
wt switch - Switch to a worktree

Usage: wt switch [OPTIONS] <BRANCH>

Arguments:
  <BRANCH>
          Branch or worktree name

          Shortcuts: '^' (main), '-' (previous), '@' (current)

Options:
  -c, --create
          Create a new branch

  -b, --base <BASE>
          Base branch

          Defaults to default branch.

  -x, --execute <EXECUTE>
          Command to run after switch

          Replaces the wt process with the command after switching, giving it
          full terminal control. Useful for launching editors, AI agents, or
          other interactive tools.

          Especially useful in shell aliases to create a worktree and start
          working in one command:

            alias wsc='wt switch --create --execute=claude'

          Then wsc feature-branch creates the worktree and launches Claude Code.

  -f, --force
          Skip approval prompts

      --no-verify
          Skip hooks

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Global Options:
  -C <path>
          Working directory for this command

      --config <path>
          User config file path

  -v, --verbose
          Show commands and debug info
```
