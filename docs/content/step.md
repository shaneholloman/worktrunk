<!-- ⚠️ AUTO-GENERATED from `wt step --help-page` — edit cli.rs to update -->

Run individual git workflow operations: commits, squashes, rebases, and pushes.

## Examples

Commit with LLM-generated message:

```bash
wt step commit
```

Manual merge workflow with review between steps:

```bash
wt step commit
wt step squash
# Review the squashed commit
wt step rebase
wt step push
```

## Operations

- `commit` — Stage and commit with [LLM-generated message](@/llm-commits.md)
- `squash` — Squash all branch commits into one with [LLM-generated message](@/llm-commits.md)
- `rebase` — Rebase onto target branch
- `push` — Push to target branch (default: main)
- `for-each` — [experimental] Run a command in every worktree

## See also

- [wt merge](@/merge.md) — Runs commit → squash → rebase → hooks → push → cleanup automatically
- [wt hook](@/hook.md) — Run hooks independently

## wt step for-each

Executes a command sequentially in every worktree with real-time output. Continues on failure and shows a summary at the end.

Context JSON is piped to stdin for scripts that need structured data.

### Template variables

All variables are shell-escaped:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{ branch }}` | Branch name (raw, e.g., `feature/foo`) |
| `{{ branch \| sanitize }}` | Branch name with `/` and `\` replaced by `-` |
| `{{ worktree }}` | Absolute path to the worktree |
| `{{ worktree_name }}` | Worktree directory name |
| `{{ repo }}` | Repository name |
| `{{ repo_root }}` | Absolute path to the main repository root |

### Examples

Check status across all worktrees:

wt step for-each -- npm install
```

Use branch name in command:

```bash
wt step for-each -- "echo Branch: {{ branch }}"
```
