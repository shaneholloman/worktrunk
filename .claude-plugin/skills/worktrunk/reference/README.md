Worktrunk is a CLI tool which makes working with git worktrees much more fluid.
It's designed for those running many concurrent AI coding agents.

For context, git worktrees let multiple agents work on a single repo without
colliding; each agent gets a separate directory with a version of the code. But
creating worktrees, tracking paths & statuses, cleaning up, etc, is manual.
Worktrunk offers control, transparency & automation for this workflow.

## Demo

## Quick Start

**Create a worktree:**

<!-- Output from: tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__shell_wrapper__tests__readme_example_simple_switch.snap -->

```bash
$ wt switch --create fix-auth
✅ Created new worktree for fix-auth from main at ../repo.fix-auth/
```

**After making changes, merge it back:**

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_simple.snap -->

```bash
$ wt merge
🔄 Merging 1 commit to main @ a1b2c3d (no commit/squash/rebase needed)

   * a1b2c3d (HEAD -> fix-auth) Implement JWT validation
    auth.rs | 13 +++++++++++++
    1 file changed, 13 insertions(+)
✅ Merged to main (1 commit, 1 file, +13)

```

See [`wt merge`](#wt-merge-target) for all options.

**See all active worktrees:**

```

See [`wt list`](#wt-list) for all options.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install worktrunk
wt config shell install  # Sets up shell integration
```

See [Shell Integration](#shell-integration) for details.

## Design Philosophy

Worktrunk is opinionated! It's not designed to be all things to all people. The choices optimize for agent workflows:

- Trunk-based development
- Lots of short-lived worktrees
- Terminal-based coding agents
- Inner dev loops are local
- Shell navigation
- Commits are squashed into linear histories
- Maximum automation
- Branches as handles, one branch per worktree

Adopting Worktrunk for a portion of a workflow doesn't require adopting it for
everything — standard `git worktree` commands continue working fine.

## Automation Features

### LLM Commit Messages

Worktrunk can invoke external commands during merge operations to generate
commit messages. Simon Willison's [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) tool reads
the diff and a configurable prompt, then returns a formatted commit message.

Add to `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
args = ["-m", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]
```

Then `wt merge` will generate commit messages automatically:

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_complex.snap -->

```bash
$ wt merge
🔄 Squashing 3 commits into 1 (3 files, +33)...
🔄 Generating squash commit message...
  feat(auth): Implement JWT authentication system

  Add comprehensive JWT token handling including validation, refresh logic,
  and authentication tests. This establishes the foundation for secure
  API authentication.

  - Implement token refresh mechanism with expiry handling
  - Add JWT encoding/decoding with signature verification
  - Create test suite covering all authentication flows
✅ Squashed @ a1b2c3d
```

To set up integration: run `wt config --help` to see the setup guide, or `wt config create` to create an example config file.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: Custom Prompt Templates</summary>

Worktrunk uses [minijinja
templates](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/syntax/index.html) for
commit message prompts. Customize the prompts by setting `template` (inline) or
`template-file` (external file) in the `[commit-generation]` section. Use
`squash-template` / `squash-template-file` for squash commits.

See [`config.example.toml`](dev/config.example.toml) for complete template examples
with all available variables (`git_diff`, `branch`, `recent_commits`, `commits`,
`target_branch`, `repo`).

</details>

### Project Hooks

Automate common tasks by creating `.config/wt.toml` in the repository root. Install dependencies when creating worktrees, start dev servers automatically, run tests before merging.

```toml
# Install deps when creating a worktree
[post-create-command]
"install" = "uv sync"

# Start dev server automatically
[post-start-command]
"dev" = "uv run dev"

# Run tests before merging
[pre-merge-command]
"test" = "uv run pytest"
"lint" = "uv run ruff check"
```

**Example: Creating a worktree with hooks:**

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_hooks_post_create.snap -->

```bash
$ wt switch --create feature-x
🔄 Running post-create install:
  uv sync
✅ Created new worktree for feature-x from main at ../repo.feature-x/
🔄 Running post-start dev:
  uv run dev

  Resolved 24 packages in 145ms
  Installed 24 packages in 1.2s
```

**Example: Merging with pre-merge hooks:**

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__merge__readme_example_hooks_pre_merge.snap -->

```bash
$ wt merge

| **pre-merge-command**   | After rebase completes during `wt merge` (validates rebased state before push) | Sequential, blocking, fail-fast               | Terminates merge immediately |
| **post-merge-command**  | After successful merge and push to target branch, before cleanup               | Sequential, blocking                          | Logs warning, continues      |

**Template variables:** `{{ repo }}`, `{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, `{{ repo_root }}`, `{{ target }}`

**Skipping hooks:** `wt switch --no-verify` or `wt merge --no-verify`

**Security:** Commands require approval on first run. Use `--force` to bypass.

</details>

### Shell Integration

Worktrunk can automatically configure the shell:

```bash
wt config shell
```

This adds shell integration to config files (supports Bash, Zsh, and Fish). The
integration enables `wt switch` to change directories and `wt remove` to return
to the previous location.

For manual setup instructions, see `wt config shell --help`.

## Tips

**Create an alias for an agent** - Shell aliases streamline common workflows. For example, to create a worktree and immediately start Claude:

```bash
alias wsl='wt switch --create --execute=claude'
```

Now `wsl new-feature` creates a branch, sets up the worktree, runs initialization hooks, and launches Claude in that directory.

**Automatic branch status in Claude Code** - The Claude Code integration shows
which branches have active sessions. When Claude starts working, the branch
shows `🤖` in `wt list`. When waiting for input, it shows `💬`. Setup
instructions: [Custom Worktree Status](#custom-worktree-status).

**Auto-generated commit messages** - Simon Willison's
[llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) tool works with worktrunk's
commit generation. Install it, configure the command, and `wt merge` will
automatically generate contextual commit messages. Setup guide: [LLM Commit
Messages](#llm-commit-messages).

**Environment setup with hooks** - Use `post-create-command` (or
`post-start-command` for non-blocking) to run setup for that
path. See [Project Hooks](#project-hooks) for details:

```toml
# In .config/wt.toml
[post-create-command]
"setup" = "uv sync && nvm install"
```

**Use hooks to reduce iteration times** - [Project hooks](#project-hooks) can
dramatically speed up your workflow. For example, use `post-start-command` to
bootstrap new worktrees with pre-compiled dependencies from main via
copy-on-write, eliminating cold compiles while keeping caches isolated (see
[worktrunk's own config](.config/wt.toml)). Or use `post-merge-command` to
automatically deploy to a staging server after every merge.

**Delegate to task runners** - Reference existing Justfile/Makefile commands instead of duplicating logic:

```toml
[post-create-command]
"setup" = "just install"

[pre-merge-command]
"validate" = "just test lint"
```

## All Commands

<details>
<summary><strong><code>wt switch [branch]</code></strong> - Switch to existing worktree or create a new one</summary>

```
Usage: wt switch [OPTIONS] <BRANCH>

Arguments:
  <BRANCH>  Branch, path, '@' (HEAD), '-' (previous), or '^' (main)

Options:
  -c, --create             Create a new branch
  -C <path>                Change working directory
  -b, --base <BASE>        Base branch (defaults to default branch)
  -v, --verbose            Show git commands and debug info
  -x, --execute <EXECUTE>  Execute command after switching
  -f, --force              Skip approval prompts
      --no-verify          Skip project hooks
  -h, --help               Print help
```

**BEHAVIOR:**

Switching to Existing Worktree:

- If worktree exists for branch, changes directory via shell integration
- No hooks run
- No branch creation

Creating New Worktree (--create):

1. Creates new branch (defaults to current default branch as base)
2. Creates worktree in configured location (default: `../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }}`)
3. Runs post-create hooks sequentially (blocking)
4. Shows success message
5. Spawns post-start hooks in background (non-blocking)
6. Changes directory to new worktree via shell integration

**HOOKS:**

post-create (sequential, blocking):

- Run after worktree creation, before success message
- Typically: npm install, cargo build, setup tasks
- Failures block the operation
- Skip with --no-verify

post-start (parallel, background):

- Spawned after success message shown
- Typically: dev servers, file watchers, editors
- Run in background, failures logged but don't block
- Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-post-start-{name}.log`
- Skip with --no-verify

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Switch to existing worktree
wt switch feature-branch

# Create new worktree from main
wt switch --create new-feature

# Switch to previous worktree
wt switch -

# Create from specific base
wt switch --create hotfix --base production

# Create and run command
wt switch --create docs --execute "code ."

# Skip hooks during creation
wt switch --create temp --no-verify
```

**SHORTCUTS:**

Use '@' for current HEAD, '-' for previous, '^' for main:

```bash
wt switch @                              # Switch to current branch's worktree
wt switch -                              # Switch to previous worktree
wt switch --create new-feature --base=^  # Branch from main (default)
wt switch --create bugfix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD
wt remove @                              # Remove current worktree
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>wt merge [target]</code></strong> - Merge, push, and cleanup</summary>

```
Usage: wt merge [OPTIONS] [TARGET]

Arguments:
  [TARGET]  Target branch (defaults to default branch)

Options:
  -C <path>         Change working directory
      --no-squash   Skip commit squashing
      --no-commit   Skip commit, squash, and rebase
  -v, --verbose     Show git commands and debug info
      --no-remove   Keep worktree after merge
      --no-verify   Skip project hooks
  -f, --force       Skip approval prompts
      --tracked-only Stage tracked files only
  -h, --help        Print help
```

**LIFECYCLE:**

The merge operation follows a strict order designed for fail-fast execution:

1. **Validate branches**
   Verifies current branch exists (not detached HEAD) and determines target branch
   (defaults to repository's default branch).

2. **Auto-commit uncommitted changes**
   If working tree has uncommitted changes, stages all changes (git add -A) and commits
   with LLM message.

3. **Squash commits (default)**
   By default, counts commits since merge base with target branch. When multiple
   commits exist, squashes them into one with LLM message. Skip squashing
   with --no-squash.

   A safety backup is created before squashing if there are working tree changes.
   Recover with: `git reflog show refs/wt-backup/<branch>`

4. **Rebase onto target**
   Rebases current branch onto target branch. Detects conflicts and aborts if found.
   This fails fast before running expensive checks.

5. **Run pre-merge commands**
   Runs commands from project config's `[pre-merge-command]` after rebase completes.
   These receive `{{ target }}` placeholder for the target branch. Commands run sequentially
   and any failure aborts the merge immediately. Skip with --no-verify.

6. **Push to target**
   Fast-forward pushes to target branch. Rejects non-fast-forward pushes (ensures
   linear history). Temporarily stashes non-conflicting local edits in the target
   worktree so they don't block the push, then restores them after success.

7. **Clean up worktree and branch**
   Removes current worktree, deletes the branch, and switches to the main worktree or target
   branch if needed. Skip removal with --no-remove.

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Basic merge to main
wt merge

# Merge without squashing
wt merge --no-squash

# Keep worktree after merging
wt merge --no-remove

# Skip pre-merge commands
wt merge --no-verify
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong><code>wt remove [worktree]</code></strong> - Remove worktree and branch</summary>

```
Usage: wt remove [OPTIONS] [WORKTREES]...

Arguments:
  [WORKTREES]...  Worktree or branch (@ for current)

Options:
  -C <path>               Change working directory
      --no-delete-branch  Keep branch after removal
  -D, --force-delete      Delete unmerged branches
  -v, --verbose           Show commands and debug info
      --no-background     Run removal in foreground
  -h, --help              Print help
```

**BEHAVIOR:**

Remove Current Worktree (no arguments):

- Requires clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
- If in worktree: removes it and switches to main worktree
- If in main worktree: switches to default branch (e.g., main)
- If already on default branch in main: does nothing

Remove Specific Worktree (by name):

- Requires target worktree has clean working tree
- Removes specified worktree(s) and associated branches
- If removing current worktree, switches to main first
- Can remove multiple worktrees in one command

Remove Multiple Worktrees:

- When removing multiple, current worktree is removed last
- Prevents deleting directory you're currently in
- Each worktree must have clean working tree

**CLEANUP:**

When removing a worktree (by default):

1. Validates worktree has no uncommitted changes
2. Changes directory (if removing current worktree)
3. Spawns background removal process (non-blocking)
   - Directory deletion happens in background
   - Git worktree metadata removed in background
   - Branch deletion in background (uses git branch -d, safe delete)
   - Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log`
4. Returns immediately so you can continue working
   - Use --no-background for foreground removal (blocking)

**EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# Remove current worktree and branch
wt remove

# Remove specific worktree and branch
wt remove feature-branch

# Remove worktree but keep branch
wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch

# Remove multiple worktrees
wt remove old-feature another-branch

# Remove in foreground (blocking)
wt remove --no-background feature-branch

# Switch to default in main
wt remove  # (when already in main worktree)

wt config create  # Create global config with examples
wt config --help  # Show LLM setup guide
```

<details>
<summary>Configuration details</summary>

**Global config** (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`):

- `worktree-path` - Path template for new worktrees
- `[list]` - Default display options for `wt list` (full, branches, remotes)
- `[commit-generation]` - LLM command and prompt templates
- `[projects."project-id"]` - Per-project approved commands (auto-populated)

**Project config** (`.config/wt.toml` in repository root):

- `[post-create-command]` - Commands after worktree creation
- `[post-start-command]` - Background commands after creation
- `[pre-commit-command]` - Validation before committing
- `[pre-merge-command]` - Validation before merge
- `[post-merge-command]` - Cleanup after merge

---

**Example global config** (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`):

```toml
worktree-path = "../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }}"

[commit-generation]
command = "llm"
args = ["-m", "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"]

# Approved commands (auto-populated when approving project hooks)
[projects."github.com/user/repo"]
approved-commands = ["npm install", "npm test"]
```

**Example project config** (`.config/wt.toml`): See Project Hooks section above.

**Path template defaults:** `../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }}` (siblings to main repo). Available variables: `{{ main_worktree }}`, `{{ branch }}`, `{{ repo }}`.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Worktree Status

Add emoji status markers to branches that appear in `wt list`.

```bash
# Set status for current branch
wt config status set "🤖"

# Or use git config directly
git config worktrunk.status.feature-x "💬"
```

**Status appears in the Status column:**

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__list__with_user_status.snap -->

```
Branch             Status  HEAD±  main↕  Path                 Remote⇅  Commit    Age            Message
main                                     ./test-repo                   b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
clean-no-status    ≡                     ./clean-no-status             b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
clean-with-status  ≡ 💬                  ./clean-with-status           b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
dirty-no-status     !      +1 -1         ./dirty-no-status             b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
dirty-with-status  ≡?🤖                  ./dirty-with-status           b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
```

The custom emoji appears directly after the git status symbols.

<details>
<summary>Automation with Claude Code Hooks</summary>

Claude Code can automatically set/clear emoji status when coding sessions start and end. This shows which branches have active AI sessions.

**Easy setup:** The Worktrunk repository includes a `.claude-plugin` directory with pre-configured hooks.

When using Claude:

- Sets status to `🤖` for the current branch when submitting a prompt (working)
- Changes to `💬` when Claude needs input (waiting for permission or idle)
- Clears the status completely when the session ends

**Status from another terminal:**

<!-- Output from: tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__list__with_user_status.snap -->

```bash
$ wt list
Branch             Status  HEAD±  main↕  Path                 Remote⇅  Commit    Age            Message
main                                     ./test-repo                   b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
clean-no-status    ≡                     ./clean-no-status             b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
clean-with-status  ≡ 💬                  ./clean-with-status           b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
dirty-no-status     !      +1 -1         ./dirty-no-status             b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit
dirty-with-status  ≡?🤖                  ./dirty-with-status           b834638e  10 months ago  Initial commit

⚪ Showing 5 worktrees, 1 with changes
```

**How it works:**

- Status is stored as `worktrunk.status.<branch>` in `.git/config`
- Each branch can have its own status emoji
- The hooks automatically detect the current branch and set/clear its status
- Works with any git repository, no special configuration needed

### Custom Worktree Paths

By default, worktrees live as siblings to the main repo:

```
myapp/               # main worktree
myapp.feature-x/     # secondary worktree
myapp.bugfix-y/      # secondary worktree
```

Customize the pattern in `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`:

```toml
# Inside the repo (keeps everything contained)
worktree-path = ".worktrees/{{ branch }}"

# Shared directory with multiple repos
worktree-path = "../worktrees/{{ main_worktree }}/{{ branch }}"
```

## Status

Worktrunk is in active development. The core features are stable and ready for use. While the project is pre-1.0, the CLI interface and major features are unlikely to change significantly.

### Releases

Use [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) to publish new versions:

```bash
cargo install cargo-release

# Bump version, update Cargo.lock, commit, tag, and push
cargo release patch --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
cargo release minor --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
cargo release major --execute   # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
```

This updates Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock, creates a commit and tag, then pushes to GitHub. The tag push triggers GitHub Actions to build binaries, create the release, and publish to crates.io.

Run without `--execute` to preview changes first.

## FAQ

### What commands does Worktrunk execute?

Worktrunk executes commands in three contexts:

1. **Project hooks** (`.config/wt.toml`) - Automation for worktree lifecycle
2. **LLM commands** (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) - Commit message generation
3. **--execute flag** - Commands provided explicitly

Commands from project hooks and LLM configuration require approval on first run. Approved commands are saved to `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` under the project's configuration. If a command changes, worktrunk requires new approval.

**Example approval prompt:**

<!-- Output from: tests/integration_tests/snapshots/integration__integration_tests__approval_pty__approval_prompt_named_commands.snap -->

```
🟡 test-repo needs approval to execute 3 commands:

🔄 post-create install:
  echo 'Installing dependencies...'

🔄 post-create build:
  echo 'Building project...'

🔄 post-create test:
  echo 'Running tests...'

💡 Allow and remember? [y/N]
```

Use `--force` to bypass prompts (useful for CI/automation).

### How does Worktrunk compare to alternatives?

#### vs. Branch Switching

`git checkout` forces all work through a single directory. Switching branches means rebuilding artifacts, restarting dev servers, and stashing changes. Only one branch can be active at a time.

Worktrunk gives each branch its own directory with independent build caches, processes, and editor state. Work on multiple branches simultaneously without rebuilding or stashing.

#### vs. Plain `git worktree`

Git's built-in worktree commands work but require manual lifecycle management:

```bash
# Plain git worktree workflow
git worktree add -b feature-branch ../myapp-feature main
cd ../myapp-feature
# ...work, commit, push...
cd ../myapp
git merge feature-branch
git worktree remove ../myapp-feature
git branch -d feature-branch
```

Worktrunk automates the full lifecycle:

```bash
wt switch --create feature-branch  # Creates worktree, runs setup hooks
# ...work...
wt merge                            # Squashes, merges, removes worktree
```

What `git worktree` doesn't provide:

- Consistent directory naming and cleanup validation
- Project-specific automation (install dependencies, start services)
- Unified status across all worktrees (commits, CI, conflicts, changes)

Worktrunk adds path management, lifecycle hooks, and `wt list --full` for viewing all worktrees—branches, uncommitted changes, commits ahead/behind, CI status, and conflicts—in a single view.

#### vs. git-machete / git-town

Different scopes:

- **git-machete**: Branch stack management in a single directory
- **git-town**: Git workflow automation in a single directory
- **worktrunk**: Multi-worktree management with hooks and status aggregation

These tools can be used together—run git-machete or git-town inside individual worktrees.

#### vs. Git TUIs (lazygit, gh-dash, etc.)

Git TUIs operate on a single repository. Worktrunk manages multiple worktrees, runs automation hooks, and aggregates status across branches (`wt list --full`). Use your preferred TUI inside each worktree directory.

### Installation fails with C compilation errors

If you encounter errors related to tree-sitter or C compilation (like "error: 'for' loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode" or "undefined reference to le16toh"), install without syntax highlighting:

```bash
cargo install worktrunk --no-default-features
```

This disables bash syntax highlighting in command output but keeps all core functionality. The syntax highlighting feature requires C99 compiler support and can fail on older systems or minimal Docker images.
