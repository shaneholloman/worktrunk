# wt merge

Merge current branch into target. Squash & rebase, fast-forward target, remove the worktree.

Unlike `git merge`, this merges current into target (not target into current). Similar to clicking "Merge pull request" on GitHub, but locally. Target defaults to the default branch.

## Examples

Merge to the default branch:

```bash
wt merge
```

Merge to a different branch:

```bash
wt merge develop
```

Keep the worktree after merging:

```bash
wt merge --no-remove
```

Preserve commit history (no squash):

```bash
wt merge --no-squash
```

Skip committing/squashing (rebase still runs unless --no-rebase):

```bash
wt merge --no-commit
```

## Pipeline

`wt merge` runs these steps:

1. **Squash** — Stages uncommitted changes, then combines all commits since target into one (like GitHub's "Squash and merge"). Use `--stage` to control what gets staged: `all` (default), `tracked`, or `none`. A backup ref is saved to `refs/wt-backup/<branch>`. With `--no-squash`, uncommitted changes become a separate commit and individual commits are preserved.
2. **Rebase** — Rebases onto target if behind. Skipped if already up-to-date. Conflicts abort immediately.
3. **Pre-merge hooks** — Hooks run after rebase, before merge. Failures abort. See [`wt hook`](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/).
4. **Merge** — Fast-forward merge to the target branch. Non-fast-forward merges are rejected.
5. **Pre-remove hooks** — Hooks run before removing worktree. Failures abort.
6. **Cleanup** — Removes the worktree and branch. Use `--no-remove` to keep the worktree. When already on the target branch or in the main worktree, the worktree is preserved.
7. **Post-merge hooks** — Hooks run after cleanup. Failures are logged but don't abort.

Use `--no-commit` to skip committing uncommitted changes and squashing; rebase still runs by default and can rewrite commits unless `--no-rebase` is passed. Useful after preparing commits manually with `wt step`. Requires a clean working tree.

## Local CI

For personal projects, pre-merge hooks open up the possibility of a workflow with much faster iteration — an order of magnitude more small changes instead of fewer large ones.

Historically, ensuring tests ran before merging was difficult to enforce locally. Remote CI was valuable for the process as much as the checks: it guaranteed validation happened. `wt merge` brings that guarantee local.

The full workflow: start an agent (one of many) on a task, work elsewhere, return when it's ready. Review the diff, run `wt merge`, move on. Pre-merge hooks validate before merging — if they pass, the branch goes to the default branch and the worktree cleans up.

```toml
[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
lint = "cargo clippy"
```
