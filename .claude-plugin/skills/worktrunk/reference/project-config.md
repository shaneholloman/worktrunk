# Project Config Reference

Detailed guidance for configuring project-specific Worktrunk hooks at `.config/wt.toml`.

## Guiding Principle: Proactive and Validated

Unlike user config, project config can be created directly since:
- Changes are versioned in git (easily reversible)
- Benefits the entire team
- Standard practice for dev tooling

Always validate commands exist before adding them to config.

## New Project

When users say "set up some hooks for me", follow this discovery process:

### Step 1: Detect Project Type

Check for package manifests:
```bash
ls package.json Cargo.toml pyproject.toml pom.xml go.mod
```

### Step 2: Identify Available Commands

<example type="detecting-npm-scripts">

For npm projects, read `package.json`:
```bash
cat package.json | grep -A 20 '"scripts"'
```

Look for: `lint`, `test`, `typecheck`, `build`, `format`

</example>

<example type="detecting-cargo-commands">

For Rust projects, common commands:
- `cargo build`
- `cargo test`
- `cargo clippy`
- `cargo fmt --check`

</example>

### Step 3: Design Appropriate Hooks

Match hooks to project needs using this decision tree:

- **Dependency installation** (fast, must complete) → `post-create-command`
- **Tests/linting** (fast, must pass) → `pre-commit-command` or `pre-merge-command`
- **Long builds** (slow, optional) → `post-start-command`
- **Deployment** (after merge) → `post-merge-command`

### Step 4: Validate Commands Work

Before adding to config, check:
```bash
npm run lint    # Check script exists
which cargo     # Check tool exists
```

### Step 5: Create `.config/wt.toml`

<example type="npm-project-config">

Typical npm project:
```toml
# Install dependencies when creating new worktrees (blocking)
post-create-command = "npm install"

# Validate code quality before committing (blocking, fail-fast)
pre-commit-command = [
    "npm run lint",
    "npm run typecheck"
]

# Run tests before merging (blocking, fail-fast)
pre-merge-command = "npm test"
```

</example>

<example type="rust-project-config">

Typical Rust project:
```toml
# Build runs in background (slow)
post-start-command = "cargo build"

# Format and lint before committing (blocking, fail-fast)
pre-commit-command = [
    "cargo fmt --check",
    "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
]

# Run tests before merging (blocking, fail-fast)
pre-merge-command = "cargo test"
```

</example>

### Step 6: Add Comments Explaining Choices

Document why each hook exists:
```toml
# Dependencies must be installed before worktree is usable
post-create-command = "npm install"

# Enforce code quality standards (matches CI checks)
pre-commit-command = ["npm run lint", "npm run typecheck"]
```

### Step 7: Suggest Testing

```bash
# Create a test worktree to verify hooks work
wt switch --create test-hooks
```

## Add Hook

When users want to add automation to an existing project:

### Step 1: Read Existing Config

```bash
cat .config/wt.toml
```

### Step 2: Determine Appropriate Hook Type

Ask: When should this run?
- Creating worktree → `post-create-command`
- Switching to worktree → `post-start-command`
- Before committing → `pre-commit-command`
- Before merging → `pre-merge-command`
- After merging → `post-merge-command`

### Step 3: Handle Format Conversion if Needed

<example type="adding-to-single-command">

Current:
```toml
post-create-command = "npm install"
```

Adding "npm run db:migrate":
```toml
post-create-command = [
    "npm install",
    "npm run db:migrate"
]
```

</example>

<example type="adding-to-array">

Current:
```toml
pre-commit-command = ["npm run lint"]
```

Adding typecheck:
```toml
pre-commit-command = [
    "npm run lint",
    "npm run typecheck"
]
```

</example>

### Step 4: Update the File

Preserve existing structure and comments.

## Variables

All hooks support template variables for dynamic behavior.

### Basic Variables (All Hooks)

Available in all hook types:
- `{repo}` - Repository name (e.g., "my-project")
- `{branch}` - Branch name (e.g., "feature-auth")
- `{worktree}` - Absolute path to worktree
- `{repo_root}` - Absolute path to repository root

<example type="basic-variables">

```toml
post-create-command = "echo 'Working on {branch} in {repo}'"
```

</example>

### Merge Variables (Merge Hooks Only)

Available in: `pre-commit-command`, `pre-merge-command`, `post-merge-command`

Additional variable:
- `{target}` - Target branch for merge (e.g., "main")

<example type="conditional-with-variables">

Run different tests based on target branch:
```toml
pre-merge-command = """
if [ "{target}" = "main" ]; then
    npm run test:full
else
    npm run test:quick
fi
"""
```

</example>

## Formats

All hooks support three command formats.

### Single Command (String)

```toml
post-create-command = "npm install"
```

### Multiple Commands (Array)

```toml
post-create-command = [
    "npm install",
    "npm run build"
]
```

Behavior:
- `post-create-command`: Sequential
- `post-start-command`: Parallel
- `pre-commit-command`: Sequential
- `pre-merge-command`: Sequential
- `post-merge-command`: Sequential

### Named Commands (Table)

```toml
[post-create-command]
dependencies = "npm install"
database = "npm run db:migrate"
services = "docker-compose up -d"
```

Behavior same as array format, but with descriptive names.

## Hook Types

Five hook types with different timing and behavior:

### post-create-command

**When**: After creating new worktree, before switching to it
**Blocking**: Yes (user waits)
**Fail-fast**: No (shows error but continues)
**Execution**: Sequential

**Use for**:
- Installing dependencies (npm install, cargo build)
- Database migrations
- Any setup that must complete before work begins

<example type="post-create">

```toml
post-create-command = [
    "npm install",
    "npm run db:migrate"
]
```

</example>

### post-start-command

**When**: After switching to existing worktree
**Blocking**: No (runs in background)
**Fail-fast**: No
**Execution**: Parallel

**Use for**:
- Long builds
- Cache warming
- Background sync

<example type="post-start">

```toml
post-start-command = [
    "npm run build",
    "docker-compose up -d"
]
```

</example>

### pre-commit-command

**When**: Before committing during merge
**Blocking**: Yes
**Fail-fast**: Yes (any failure aborts commit)
**Execution**: Sequential

**Use for**:
- Linting
- Formatting checks
- Type checking

<example type="pre-commit">

```toml
pre-commit-command = [
    "npm run lint",
    "npm run typecheck"
]
```

</example>

### pre-merge-command

**When**: Before merging to target branch
**Blocking**: Yes
**Fail-fast**: Yes (any failure aborts merge)
**Execution**: Sequential

**Use for**:
- Running tests
- Build verification
- Security scans

<example type="pre-merge">

```toml
pre-merge-command = "npm test"
```

</example>

### post-merge-command

**When**: After successful merge, before cleanup
**Blocking**: Yes
**Fail-fast**: No (merge already complete)
**Execution**: Sequential

**Use for**:
- Deployment
- Notifications
- Cache invalidation

<example type="post-merge">

```toml
post-merge-command = "npm run deploy"
```

</example>

See `hook-types-reference.md` for complete behavioral details.

## Validation & Safety

### Before Adding Commands

Check commands are safe and exist:

<example type="validation-checks">

```bash
# Verify command exists
which npm
which cargo

# For npm, verify script exists
npm run lint --dry-run

# For shell commands, check syntax
bash -n -c "if [ true ]; then echo ok; fi"
```

</example>

### Dangerous Patterns

Warn before creating hooks with:
- Destructive commands: `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`
- External dependencies: `curl http://...`
- Privilege escalation: `sudo`

Reject obviously dangerous commands:
- `rm -rf /`
- Fork bombs
- Arbitrary code execution

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

Check sequence:
1. Verify `.config/wt.toml` exists: `ls -la .config/wt.toml`
2. Check TOML syntax: `cat .config/wt.toml`
3. Verify hook name spelling matches one of the five types
4. Test command manually in terminal

### Hook Failing

Debug steps:
1. Run command manually in worktree
2. Check for missing dependencies (npm packages, system tools)
3. Verify template variables expand correctly
4. For background hooks, check `.wt-logs/` for output

### Slow Blocking Hooks

Move long-running commands to background:

<example type="blocking-to-background">

Before (blocks for minutes):
```toml
post-create-command = "npm run build"
```

After (runs in background):
```toml
post-create-command = "npm install"  # Fast, blocking
post-start-command = "npm run build"  # Slow, background
```

</example>

## Key Commands

```bash
wt config list                    # View project config
cat .config/wt.toml               # Read config directly
wt switch --create test-hooks     # Test hooks work
```

## Config File Location

- **Always at**: `<repo>/.config/wt.toml` (checked into git)
- **Background logs**: `.wt-logs/` (gitignored)

## Example Config

See `.config/wt.example.toml` in the worktrunk repository for a complete annotated example.
