# wt hook

Run configured hooks.

Hooks are shell commands that run at key points in the worktree lifecycle — automatically during `wt switch`, `wt merge`, & `wt remove`, or on demand via `wt hook <type>`. Both user (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) and project (`.config/wt.toml`) hooks are supported.

## Hook types

| Hook | When | Blocking | Fail-fast |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| `post-start` | After worktree created | No (background) | No |
| `post-create` | After worktree created | Yes | No |
| `post-switch` | After every switch | No (background) | No |
| `pre-commit` | Before commit during merge | Yes | Yes |
| `pre-merge` | Before merging to target | Yes | Yes |
| `post-merge` | After successful merge | Yes | No |
| `pre-remove` | Before worktree removed | Yes | Yes |
| `post-remove` | After worktree removed | No (background) | No |

**Blocking**: Command waits for hook to complete before continuing.
**Fail-fast**: First failure aborts the operation.

Background hooks show a single-line summary by default. Use `-v` to see expanded command details.

### post-start

Dev servers, long builds, file watchers, copying caches. Output logged to `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-{source}-post-start-{name}.log`.

```toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
server = "npm run dev -- --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

### post-create

Tasks that must complete before `post-start` hooks or `--execute` run: dependency installation, environment file generation.

```toml
[post-create]
install = "npm ci"
env = "echo 'PORT={{ branch | hash_port }}' > .env.local"
```

### post-switch

Triggers on all switch results: creating new worktrees, switching to existing ones, or staying on current. Output logged to `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-{source}-post-switch-{name}.log`.

```toml
[post-switch]
tmux = "[ -n \"$TMUX\" ] && tmux rename-window {{ branch | sanitize }}"
```

### pre-commit

Formatters, linters, type checking — runs during `wt merge` before the squash commit.

```toml
[pre-commit]
format = "cargo fmt -- --check"
lint = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
```

### pre-merge

Tests, security scans, build verification — runs after rebase, before merge to target.

```toml
[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
build = "cargo build --release"
```

### post-merge

Deployment, notifications, installing updated binaries. Runs in the target branch worktree if it exists, otherwise the main worktree.

```toml
post-merge = "cargo install --path ."
```

### pre-remove

Cleanup tasks before worktree is deleted, saving test artifacts, backing up state. Runs in the worktree being removed, with access to worktree files.

```toml
[pre-remove]
archive = "tar -czf ~/.wt-logs/{{ branch }}.tar.gz test-results/ logs/ 2>/dev/null || true"
```

### post-remove

Cleanup tasks after worktree removal: stopping dev servers, removing containers, notifying external systems. All template variables reference the removed worktree, so cleanup scripts can identify resources to clean up. Output logged to `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-{source}-post-remove-{name}.log`.

```toml
[post-remove]
kill-server = "lsof -ti :{{ branch | hash_port }} -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs kill 2>/dev/null || true"
remove-db = "docker stop {{ repo }}-{{ branch | sanitize }}-postgres 2>/dev/null || true"
```

During `wt merge`, hooks run in this order: pre-commit → pre-merge → pre-remove → post-remove → post-merge. See [`wt merge`](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/#pipeline) for the complete pipeline.

## Security

Project commands require approval on first run:

```
▲ repo needs approval to execute 3 commands:

○ post-create install:
   echo 'Installing dependencies...'

❯ Allow and remember? [y/N]
```

- Approvals are saved to user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`)
- If a command changes, new approval is required
- Use `--yes` to bypass prompts (useful for CI/automation)
- Use `--no-verify` to skip hooks

Manage approvals with `wt hook approvals add` and `wt hook approvals clear`.

## Configuration

Hooks can be defined in two places: project config (`.config/wt.toml`) for repository-specific automation, or user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) for personal automation across all repositories.

### Project hooks

Project hooks are defined in `.config/wt.toml`. They can be a single command or multiple named commands:

```toml
# Single command (string)
post-create = "npm install"

# Multiple commands (table) — run sequentially in declaration order
[pre-merge]
test = "cargo test"
build = "cargo build --release"
```

### User hooks

Define hooks in `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` to run for all repositories. User hooks run before project hooks and don't require approval. For repository-specific user hooks, see [setting overrides](https://worktrunk.dev/config/#setting-overrides-experimental).

```toml
# ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml
[post-create]
setup = "echo 'Setting up worktree...'"

[pre-merge]
notify = "notify-send 'Merging {{ branch }}'"
```

User hooks support the same hook types and template variables as project hooks.

**Key differences from project hooks:**

| Aspect | Project hooks | User hooks |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Location | `.config/wt.toml` | `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` |
| Scope | Single repository | All repositories (or per-project) |
| Approval | Required | Not required |
| Execution order | After user hooks | Global first, then per-project |

Skip hooks with `--no-verify`. To run a specific hook when user and project both define the same name, use `user:name` or `project:name` syntax.

**Use cases:**
- Personal notifications or logging
- Editor/IDE integration
- Repository-agnostic setup tasks

### Template variables

Hooks can use template variables that expand at runtime:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{ repo }}` | Repository directory name |
| `{{ repo_path }}` | Absolute path to repository root |
| `{{ branch }}` | Branch name |
| `{{ worktree_name }}` | Worktree directory name |
| `{{ worktree_path }}` | Absolute worktree path |
| `{{ primary_worktree_path }}` | Primary worktree path (main worktree for normal repos; default branch worktree for bare repos) |
| `{{ default_branch }}` | Default branch name |
| `{{ commit }}` | Full HEAD commit SHA |
| `{{ short_commit }}` | Short HEAD commit SHA (7 chars) |
| `{{ remote }}` | Primary remote name |
| `{{ remote_url }}` | Remote URL |
| `{{ upstream }}` | Upstream tracking branch (if set) |
| `{{ target }}` | Target branch (merge hooks only) |
| `{{ base }}` | Base branch (creation hooks only) |
| `{{ base_worktree_path }}` | Base branch worktree (creation hooks only) |

Some variables may not be defined: `upstream` is only set when the branch tracks a remote; `target`, `base`, and `base_worktree_path` are hook-specific. Using an undefined variable directly errors — use conditionals for optional behavior:

```toml
[post-create]
# Rebase onto upstream if tracking a remote branch (e.g., wt switch --create feature origin/feature)
sync = "{% if upstream %}git fetch && git rebase {{ upstream }}{% endif %}"
```

### Worktrunk filters

Templates support Jinja2 filters for transforming values:

| Filter | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `sanitize` | `{{ branch \| sanitize }}` | Replace `/` and `\` with `-` |
| `sanitize_db` | `{{ branch \| sanitize_db }}` | Database-safe identifier with hash suffix (`[a-z0-9_]`, max 63 chars) |
| `hash_port` | `{{ branch \| hash_port }}` | Hash to port 10000-19999 |

The `sanitize` filter makes branch names safe for filesystem paths. The `sanitize_db` filter produces database-safe identifiers (lowercase alphanumeric and underscores, no leading digits, with a 3-character hash suffix to avoid collisions and reserved words). The `hash_port` filter is useful for running dev servers on unique ports per worktree:

```toml
[post-start]
dev = "npm run dev -- --host {{ branch }}.lvh.me --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

Hash any string, including concatenations:

```toml
# Unique port per repo+branch combination
dev = "npm run dev --port {{ (repo ~ '-' ~ branch) | hash_port }}"
```

Variables are shell-escaped automatically — quotes around `{{ ... }}` are unnecessary and can cause issues with special characters.

### Worktrunk functions

Templates also support functions for dynamic lookups:

| Function | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `worktree_path_of_branch(branch)` | `{{ worktree_path_of_branch("main") }}` | Look up the path of a branch's worktree |

The `worktree_path_of_branch` function returns the filesystem path of a worktree given a branch name, or an empty string if no worktree exists for that branch. This is useful for referencing files in other worktrees:

```toml
[post-create]
# Copy config from main worktree
setup = "cp {{ worktree_path_of_branch('main') }}/config.local {{ worktree_path }}"
```

### JSON context

Hooks receive context as JSON on stdin, enabling complex logic that templates can't express:

```python
import json, sys, subprocess
ctx = json.load(sys.stdin)
# Run extra setup for feature branches on backend repos
if ctx['branch'].startswith('feature/') and 'backend' in ctx['repo']:
    subprocess.run(['make', 'seed-db'])
```

The JSON includes all template variables plus `hook_type` and `hook_name`.

## Running hooks manually

`wt hook <type>` runs hooks on demand — useful for testing during development, running in CI pipelines, or re-running after a failure.

```bash
wt hook pre-merge              # Run all pre-merge hooks
wt hook pre-merge test         # Run hooks named "test" from both sources
wt hook pre-merge user:        # Run all user hooks
wt hook pre-merge project:     # Run all project hooks
wt hook pre-merge user:test    # Run only user's "test" hook
wt hook pre-merge project:test # Run only project's "test" hook
wt hook pre-merge --yes        # Skip approval prompts (for CI)
wt hook post-create --var branch=feature/test  # Override template variable
```

The `user:` and `project:` prefixes filter by source. Use `user:` or `project:` alone to run all hooks from that source, or `user:name` / `project:name` to run a specific hook.

The `--var KEY=VALUE` flag overrides built-in template variables — useful for testing hooks with different contexts without switching to that context.

## Designing effective hooks

### post-start vs post-create

Both run when creating a worktree. The difference:

| Hook | Execution | Best for |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `post-start` | Background, parallel | Long-running tasks that don't block worktree creation |
| `post-create` | Blocks until complete | Tasks the developer needs before working (dependency install) |

Many tasks work well in `post-start` — they'll likely be ready by the time they're needed, especially when the fallback is recompiling. If unsure, prefer `post-start` for faster worktree creation.

Background processes spawned by `post-start` outlive the worktree — pair them with `post-remove` hooks to clean up. See [Dev servers](#dev-servers) and [Databases](#databases) for examples.

### Copying untracked files

Git worktrees share the repository but not untracked files. [`wt step copy-ignored`](https://worktrunk.dev/step/#wt-step-copy-ignored) copies gitignored files between worktrees:

```toml
[post-start]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

Use `post-create` instead if subsequent hooks or `--execute` command need the copied files immediately.

### Dev servers

Run a dev server per worktree on a deterministic port using `hash_port`:

```toml
[post-start]
server = "npm run dev -- --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"

[post-remove]
server = "lsof -ti :{{ branch | hash_port }} -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs kill 2>/dev/null || true"
```

The port is stable across machines and restarts — `feature-api` always gets the same port. Show it in `wt list`:

```toml
[list]
url = "http://localhost:{{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

For subdomain-based routing (useful for cookies/CORS), use `lvh.me` which resolves to 127.0.0.1:

```toml
[post-start]
server = "npm run dev -- --host {{ branch | sanitize }}.lvh.me --port {{ branch | hash_port }}"
```

### Databases

Each worktree can have its own database. Docker containers get unique names and ports:

```toml
[post-start]
db = """
docker run -d --rm \
  --name {{ repo }}-{{ branch | sanitize }}-postgres \
  -p {{ ('db-' ~ branch) | hash_port }}:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB={{ branch | sanitize_db }} \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev \
  postgres:16
"""

[post-remove]
db-stop = "docker stop {{ repo }}-{{ branch | sanitize }}-postgres 2>/dev/null || true"
```

The `('db-' ~ branch)` concatenation hashes differently than plain `branch`, so database and dev server ports don't collide.
Jinja2's operator precedence has pipe `|` with higher precedence than concatenation `~`, meaning expressions need parentheses to filter concatenated values.

Generate `.env.local` with the connection string:

```toml
[post-create]
env = """
cat > .env.local << EOF
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:{{ ('db-' ~ branch) | hash_port }}/{{ branch | sanitize_db }}
DEV_PORT={{ branch | hash_port }}
EOF
"""
```

### Progressive validation

Quick checks before commit, thorough validation before merge:

```toml
[pre-commit]
lint = "npm run lint"
typecheck = "npm run typecheck"

[pre-merge]
test = "npm test"
build = "npm run build"
```

### Target-specific behavior

Different actions for production vs staging:

```toml
post-merge = """
if [ {{ target }} = main ]; then
    npm run deploy:production
elif [ {{ target }} = staging ]; then
    npm run deploy:staging
fi
"""
```

### Python virtual environments

Use `uv sync` to recreate virtual environments (or `python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` for pip-based projects):

```toml
[post-create]
install = "uv sync"
```

# Subcommands

## wt hook approvals

Manage command approvals.

Project hooks require approval on first run to prevent untrusted projects from running arbitrary commands.

### Examples

Pre-approve all commands for current project:
```bash
wt hook approvals add
```

Clear approvals for current project:
```bash
wt hook approvals clear
```

Clear global approvals:
```bash
wt hook approvals clear --global
```

### How approvals work

Approved commands are saved to user config. Re-approval is required when the command template changes or the project moves. Use `--yes` to bypass prompts in CI.
