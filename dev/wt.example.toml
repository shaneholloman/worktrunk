# Worktrunk Project Configuration
# Copy to: <repo>/.config/wt.toml
#
# This file defines project-specific hooks that run automatically during
# worktree operations. It should be checked into git and shared across all
# developers working on the project.

# Available template variables (all hooks):
#   {{ repo }}              - Repository name (e.g., "my-project")
#   {{ branch }}            - Raw branch name (e.g., "feature/foo")
#   {{ branch | sanitize }} - Branch name with / and \ replaced by -
#   {{ worktree }}          - Absolute path to the worktree
#   {{ repo_root }}         - Absolute path to the repository root
#
# Merge-related hooks also support:
#   {{ target }}    - Target branch for the merge (e.g., "main")

# Post-Create Hook
# Runs SEQUENTIALLY and BLOCKS until complete
# The worktree switch won't complete until these finish
# Commands run one after another in the worktree directory
#
# Format options:
# 1. Single string:
#    post-create = "npm install"
#
# 2. Named table (runs sequentially in declaration order):
# [post-create]
# install = "npm install --frozen-lockfile"
# build = "npm run build"

# Post-Start Hook
# Runs in BACKGROUND as detached processes (parallel)
# Use for: uv sync, npm install, bundle install, build, dev servers, file watchers,
# downloading assets too large for git (images, ML models, binaries), long-running tasks
# The worktree switch completes immediately, these run in parallel
# Output is logged to .git/wt-logs/{branch}-{source}-post-start-{name}.log (source: user/project)
#
# Format options:
# 1. Single string:
#    post-start = "npm run dev"
#
# 2. Named table (runs in parallel):
# [post-start]
# server = "npm run dev"
# watch = "npm run watch"

# Pre-Commit Hook
# Runs SEQUENTIALLY before committing changes during merge (blocking, fail-fast)
# All commands must exit with code 0 for commit to proceed
# Runs for both squash and no-squash merge modes
# Use for: formatters, linters, quick validation
#
# Single command:
# pre-commit = "cargo fmt -- --check"
#
# Multiple commands:
# [pre-commit]
# format = "cargo fmt -- --check"
# lint = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"

# Pre-Merge Hook
# Runs SEQUENTIALLY before merging to target branch (blocking, fail-fast)
# All commands must exit with code 0 for merge to proceed
# Use for: tests, linters, build verification before merging
#
# Single command:
# pre-merge = "cargo test"
#
# Multiple commands:
# [pre-merge]
# test = "cargo test"
# build = "cargo build --release"

# Post-Merge Hook
# Runs SEQUENTIALLY in the main worktree after successful merge (blocking)
# Runs after push and cleanup complete
# Use for: updating production builds, notifications, cleanup
#
# Single command:
# post-merge = "cargo install --path ."
#
# Multiple commands:
# [post-merge]
# install = "cargo install --path ."
# notify = "echo 'Merged!'"

# Example: Node.js Project
# [post-create]
# install = "npm ci"
#
# [post-start]
# server = "npm run dev"
#
# [pre-merge]
# lint = "npm run lint"
# test = "npm test"

# Example: Rust Project
# [post-create]
# build = "cargo build"
#
# [pre-merge]
# format = "cargo fmt -- --check"
# clippy = "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"
# test = "cargo test"
#
# post-merge = "cargo install --path ."

# Example: Python Project
# [post-create]
# venv = "python -m venv .venv"
# install = ".venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt"
#
# [pre-merge]
# format = ".venv/bin/black --check ."
# lint = ".venv/bin/ruff check ."
# test = ".venv/bin/pytest"
