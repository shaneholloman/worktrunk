# wt demo assets (VHS)

- Primary asset: `scripts/wt-demo/out/wt-demo.gif` (regenerated by the script; ~1.9 MB).
- VHS tape: `scripts/wt-demo/demo.tape` (edit this to adjust the recording).
- Text transcript: `scripts/wt-demo/out/run.txt` (captured from a clean run parallel to the GIF).
- Regenerate everything with `./scripts/wt-demo-build.sh` (depends on `wt`, `vhs`, `starship`).
- Script creates a fresh temp repo under `scripts/wt-demo/out/demo/` (gitignored), seeds 4 worktrees + 2 extra branches, shows `wt list --branches --full`, creates another worktree, edits a file (pre-commit hook visible during merge auto-commit), merges with `wt merge`, then shows the final list.
- Defaults: light theme (GitHub-light-inspired palette), starship prompt, 1280x720 window. Worktree paths appear as `./wt-demo*` inside the session container for readability.
- Inline viewing: `qlmanage -p scripts/wt-demo/out/wt-demo.gif` (Quick Look) or `imgcat scripts/wt-demo/out/wt-demo.gif` in iTerm2.
- Recording log: `scripts/wt-demo/out/record.log`.
