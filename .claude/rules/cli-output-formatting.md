# CLI Output Formatting Standards

## User Message Principles

Output messages should acknowledge user-supplied arguments (flags, options,
values) by reflecting those choices in the message text.

```rust
// User runs: wt switch --create feature --base=main
// GOOD - acknowledges the base branch
"Created new worktree for feature from main at /path/to/worktree"
// BAD - ignores the base argument
"Created new worktree for feature at /path/to/worktree"
```

**Avoid "you/your" pronouns:** Messages should refer to things directly, not
address the user. Imperatives like "Run", "Use", "Add" are fine — they're
concise CLI idiom.

```rust
// BAD - possessive pronoun
"Use 'wt merge' to rebase your changes onto main"
// GOOD - refers to the thing directly
"Use 'wt merge' to rebase onto main"

// BAD - possessive pronoun
"Add one line to your shell config"
// GOOD - refers to the thing directly
"Add one line to the shell config"
```

**Avoid redundant parenthesized content:** Parenthesized text should add new
information, not restate what's already said.

```rust
// BAD - parentheses restate "no changes"
"No changes after squashing 3 commits (commits resulted in no net changes)"
// GOOD - clear and concise
"No changes after squashing 3 commits"
// GOOD - parentheses add supplementary info
"Committing with default message... (3 files, +45, -12)"
```

**Two types of parenthesized content with different styling:**

1. **Stats parentheses → Gray** (`[90m` bright-black): Supplementary numerical
   info that could be omitted without losing meaning.
   ```
   ✓ Merged to main (1 commit, 1 file, +1)
   ◎ Squashing 2 commits into a single commit (2 files, +2)...
   ```

2. **Reason parentheses → Message color**: Explains WHY an action is happening;
   integral to understanding.
   ```
   ◎ Removing feature worktree & branch in background (same commit as main, _)
   ```

Stats are truly optional context. Reasons answer "why is this safe/happening?"
and belong with the main message. Symbols within reason parentheses still render
in their native styling (see "Symbol styling" below).

**Avoid pronouns with cross-message referents:** Hints appear as separate
messages from errors. Don't use pronouns like "it" that refer to something
mentioned in the error message.

```rust
// BAD - "it" refers to branch name in error message
// Error: "Branch 'feature' not found"
// Hint:  "Use --create to create it"
// GOOD - self-contained hint
// Error: "Branch 'feature' not found"
// Hint:  "Use --create to create a new branch"
```

## Message Consistency Patterns

Use consistent punctuation and structure for related messages:

**Semicolon for qualifiers:** Separate the action from a qualifier/reason:

```rust
// Action; qualifier (flag)
"Removing feature worktree in background; retaining branch (--no-delete-branch)"
"Commands approved; not saved (--force)"
```

**Ampersand for conjunctions:** Use `&` for combined actions:

```rust
// Action & additional action
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background"
"Commands approved & saved to config"
```

**Explicit flag acknowledgment:** Show flags in parentheses when they change
behavior:

```rust
// GOOD - shows the flag explicitly
"Removing feature worktree in background; retaining branch (--no-delete-branch)"
// BAD - doesn't acknowledge user's explicit choice
"Removing feature worktree in background; retaining branch"
```

**Parallel structure:** Related messages should follow the same pattern:

```rust
// GOOD - parallel structure with integration reason explaining branch deletion
// Both wt merge and wt remove show integration reason when branch is deleted
// Target branch is bold; symbol uses its standard styling (dim for _ and ⊂)
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background (same commit as <bold>main</>, <dim>_</>)"        // SameCommit
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background (ancestor of <bold>main</>, <dim>⊂</>)"           // Ancestor (main moved past)
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background (no added changes on <bold>main</>, <dim>⊂</>)"   // NoAddedChanges (empty 3-dot diff)
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background (tree matches <bold>main</>, <dim>⊂</>)"          // TreesMatch (squash/rebase)
"Removing feature worktree & branch in background (all changes in <bold>main</>, <dim>⊂</>)"        // MergeAddsNothing (squash + main advanced)
"Removing feature worktree in background; retaining unmerged branch"                         // Unmerged (system keeps)
"Removing feature worktree in background; retaining branch (--no-delete-branch)"             // User flag (user keeps)
```

**Symbol styling:** Symbols are atomic with their color — the styling is part of
the symbol's identity, not a presentation choice. Each symbol has a defined
appearance that must be preserved in all contexts:

- `_` and `⊂` — dim (integration/safe-to-delete indicators)
- `+N` and `-N` — green/red (diff indicators)

When a symbol appears in a colored message (cyan progress, green success), close
the message color before the symbol so it renders in its native styling. This
requires breaking out of the message color and reopening it after the symbol.
See `FlagNote` in `src/output/handlers.rs` for the implementation pattern.

**Comma + "but" + em-dash for limitations:** When stating an outcome with a
limitation and its reason:

```rust
// Outcome, but limitation — reason
"Worktree for feature @ ~/repo.feature, but cannot change directory — shell integration not installed"
"Worktree for feature @ ~/repo.feature, but cannot change directory — shell integration not active"
```

This pattern:
- States what succeeded (worktree exists at path)
- Uses "but" to introduce what didn't work (cannot cd)
- Uses em-dash to explain why (shell integration status)

**Compute decisions once:** For background operations, check conditions upfront,
show the message, then pass the decision explicitly rather than re-checking in
background scripts:

```rust
// GOOD - check once, pass decision
let should_delete = check_if_merged();
show_message_based_on(should_delete);
spawn_background(build_command(should_delete));

// BAD - check twice (once for message, again in background script)
let is_merged = check_if_merged();
show_message_based_on(is_merged);
spawn_background(build_command_that_checks_merge_again());  // Duplicate check!
```

## Message Types

Seven canonical message patterns with their symbols:

1. **Progress**: ◎ (operations in progress)
2. **Success**: ✓ (something was created or changed)
3. **Errors**: ✗ (failures, invalid states)
4. **Warnings**: ▲ (non-blocking issues)
5. **Hints**: ↳ (actionable — user could/should do something)
6. **Info**: ○ (status — acknowledging state or user choices, no action needed)
7. **Prompts**: ❯ (questions requiring user input)

**Success vs Info decision:** Success (✓) means something was created or
changed. Info (○) means acknowledging state without creating/changing anything.

| Success ✓                               | Info ○                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Created worktree for feature"          | "Switched to worktree for feature"    |
| "Created new worktree for feature"      | "Already on worktree for feature"     |
| "Commands approved & saved"             | "All commands already approved"       |

**Hint vs Info decision:** If the message suggests the user take an action, it's
a hint. If it's acknowledging what happened (including flag effects), it's info.

| Hint ↳                        | Info ○                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Run `wt merge` to continue"  | "Already up to date with main"        |
| "Use `--force` to override"   | "Skipping hooks (--no-verify)"        |
| "Branch can be deleted"       | "Worktree preserved (main worktree)"  |

**Command suggestions in hints:** When suggesting a command the user should run,
use the pattern "To X, run Y" where X describes the goal and Y is the command.
**Always end with the command** so users can easily copy it:

```rust
// GOOD - "To X, run Y" pattern, command at end for easy copying
"To delete the unmerged branch, run wt remove feature -D"
"To rebase onto main, run wt step rebase or wt merge"
"To create a new branch, run wt switch feature --create; to list branches, run wt list --branches"

// GOOD - when user needs to modify their command, instruction then command
"To switch to the remote branch, remove --create; run wt switch feature"

// BAD - command without context
"wt remove feature -D deletes unmerged branches"

// BAD - command not at end (hard to copy)
"Run wt switch feature (without --create) to switch to the remote branch"
```

Use `suggest_command()` from `worktrunk::styling` to build commands with proper
shell escaping. Include the branch name or other specific arguments so users can
copy-paste.

**Message formatting functions** add symbol AND semantic color. Callers provide
content with optional inner styling (like `<bold>`), then pass to
`output::print()`:

```rust
// Simple message - formatting function adds symbol + color
output::print(success_message("Created worktree"))?;
output::print(hint_message("Run 'wt config' to configure"))?;

// With inner styling - use cformat! for bold/dim within the message
output::print(success_message(cformat!("Created worktree for <bold>{branch}</>")))?;
output::print(warning_message(cformat!("Branch <bold>{name}</> not found")))?;
```

**Semantic colors from formatting functions:**

- `success_message()` → green
- `progress_message()` → cyan
- `hint_message()` → dimmed
- `warning_message()` → yellow
- `info_message()` → no color (neutral status)
- `error_message()` → red

**Every user-facing message requires either a symbol or a gutter** for
consistent visual separation.

**Section titles** (experimental): For output with distinct sections (like
`wt hook show`, `wt config show`), use cyan uppercase text without symbol:
`<cyan>SECTION TITLE</>`. This distinguishes organizational headers from status
messages. Currently being trialed — expand to other commands if it works well.

## Blank Line Principles

- **No leading/trailing blanks** — Start immediately, end cleanly
- **One blank after blocks** — Separate multi-line content (gutter blocks,
  sections)
- **One blank after prompts** — Separate user input from results
- **Never double blanks** — One blank line maximum between elements

## stdout vs stderr

**Both modes write all messages to stderr.** stdout is reserved for structured
data:

- **stdout**: JSON output (`--format=json`), shell scripts (directive mode)
- **stderr**: All user-facing messages (progress, success, errors, hints,
  gutter, etc.)

**Directive mode** additionally emits a shell script to stdout at the end.

Use the output system (`output::print()` with message formatting functions) to
handle both modes automatically. Never write directly to stdout/stderr in
command code.

```rust
// GOOD - use output system (handles both modes)
output::print(success_message("Branch created"))?;

// BAD - direct writes bypass output system
println!("Branch created");
```

Interactive prompts must flush stderr before blocking on stdin:

```rust
eprint!("❯ Allow and remember? [y/N] ");
stderr().flush()?;
io::stdin().read_line(&mut response)?;
```

## Temporal Locality: Output Should Be Close to Operations

Output should appear immediately adjacent to the operations it describes.
Progress messages apply only to slow operations (>400ms): git operations,
network requests, builds.

Sequential operations should show immediate feedback:

```rust
for item in items {
    output::print(progress_message(format!("Removing {item}...")))?;
    perform_operation(item)?;
    output::print(success_message(format!("Removed {item}")))?;  // Immediate feedback
}
```

Bad example (output decoupled from operations):

```
◎ Removing worktree for feature...
◎ Removing worktree for bugfix...
                                    ← Long delay, no feedback
Removed worktree for feature        ← All output at the end
Removed worktree for bugfix
```

Signs of poor temporal locality: collecting messages in a buffer, single success
message for batch operations, no progress before slow operations.

## Information Display: Show Once, Not Twice

Progress messages should include all relevant details (what's being done,
counts, stats, context). Success messages should be minimal, confirming
completion with reference info (hash, path).

```rust
// GOOD - detailed progress, minimal success
output::print(progress_message("Squashing 3 commits & working tree changes into a single commit (5 files, +60)..."))?;
perform_squash()?;
output::print(success_message("Squashed @ a1b2c3d"))?;
```

## Style Constants

Style constants in `src/styling/constants.rs` (minimal set for programmatic
styling):

- `ADDITION`: Green (diffs, additions) — used in table rendering
- `DELETION`: Red (diffs, deletions) — used in table rendering
- `GUTTER`: BrightWhite background (quoted content)

Symbol constants: `PROGRESS_SYMBOL` (◎), `SUCCESS_SYMBOL` (✓), `ERROR_SYMBOL` (✗),
`WARNING_SYMBOL` (▲), `HINT_SYMBOL` (↳), `INFO_SYMBOL` (○), `PROMPT_SYMBOL` (❯)

For all other styling, use color-print tags in `cformat!`: `<red>`, `<green>`,
`<yellow>`, `<cyan>`, `<dim>`, `<bold>`, `<bright-black>`

## Styling in Command Code

Use `output::print()` with message formatting functions. The formatting function
adds the symbol + semantic color, and `cformat!` handles inner styling:

```rust
// GOOD - formatting function handles symbol + outer color, cformat! handles inner styling
output::print(success_message(cformat!("Created <bold>{branch}</> from <bold>{base}</>")))?;
output::print(warning_message(cformat!("Branch <bold>{name}</> has <dim>uncommitted changes</>")))?;
output::print(hint_message(cformat!("Run <bright-black>wt merge</> to continue")))?;

// GOOD - plain strings work too (no inner styling needed)
output::print(progress_message("Rebasing onto main..."))?;
output::print(hint_message("No changes to commit"))?;
```

**Available color-print tags:** `<bold>`, `<dim>`, `<bright-black>`, `<red>`,
`<green>`, `<yellow>`, `<cyan>`, `<magenta>`

**Symbol constants in cformat!:** Use `{ERROR_SYMBOL}`, `{HINT_SYMBOL}`, etc. for
messages that bypass output:: functions (e.g., GitError Display impl):

```rust
cformat!("{ERROR_SYMBOL} <red>Branch <bold>{branch}</> not found</>")
```

Branch names in messages should be bolded. Tables (`wt list`) use `StyledLine`
with conditional styling for branch names.

## Commands and Branches in Messages

Never quote commands or branch names. Use styling to make them stand out:

- **In normal font context**: Use `<bold>` for commands and branches
- **In hints**: Use `<bright-black>` for commands (hint() already applies
  dimming — no explicit `<dim>` needed)

```rust
// GOOD - bold in normal context
output::print(info_message(cformat!("Use <bold>wt merge</> to continue")))?;

// GOOD - bright-black for commands in hints
output::print(hint_message(cformat!("Run <bright-black>wt list</> to see worktrees")))?;

// GOOD - plain hint without commands
output::print(hint_message("No changes to commit"))?;

// BAD - quoted commands
output::print(hint_message("Run 'wt list' to see worktrees"))?;
```

## Color Detection

Colors automatically adjust based on environment (NO_COLOR, CLICOLOR_FORCE, TTY
detection). When using `output::` functions, this is handled automatically.

For direct terminal I/O (rare — mainly internal output system code), import
print macros from `worktrunk::styling`:

```rust
use worktrunk::styling::eprintln;  // Auto-detects color support
```

## Design Principles

- **color-print for all styling** — Use `cformat!` with HTML-like tags
  (`<green>`, `<bold>`, etc.). Only use anstyle for `StyledLine` table
  rendering.
- **output:: functions over direct printing** — Use output:: for user messages,
  which auto-adds symbol + semantic color
- **cformat! for inner styling** — Use `<bold>`, `<dim>` tags within output::
  calls
- **Never manual escape codes** — No `\x1b[...` in code
- **YAGNI for presentation** — Most output needs no styling
- **Unicode-aware** — Width calculations respect symbols and CJK characters (via
  `StyledLine`)
- **Graceful degradation** — Must work without color support

## StyledLine API

For complex table formatting with proper width calculations, use `StyledLine`:

```rust
use worktrunk::styling::StyledLine;
use anstyle::{AnsiColor, Color, Style};

let mut line = StyledLine::new();
line.push_styled("Branch", Style::new().dimmed());
line.push_raw("  ");
line.push_styled("main", Style::new().fg_color(Some(Color::Ansi(AnsiColor::Cyan))));
println!("{}", line.render());
```

See `src/commands/list/render.rs` for advanced usage.

## Gutter Formatting for Quoted Content

Use gutter formatting for **quoted content** — anything that should be visually
distinguished from application prose:

- **External data**: git output, commit messages, config values, cached data
- **Suggested commands**: shell commands the user might run

Use `format_bash_with_gutter()` for shell commands (applies dimming + syntax
highlighting). Use `format_with_gutter()` for other content (no dimming).

**Gutter vs Table:** Tabular data structured by the application should use
`output::table()` with markdown formatting via `render_markdown_in_help()`.
Tables are artifacts; gutter is for quoting content.

**Linebreaks:** Gutter requires a single newline before it, never double.
`output::print()` adds a trailing newline, so messages should not include `\n`:

```rust
// GOOD - no trailing \n
output::print(progress_message("Merging..."))?;
output::gutter(format_with_gutter(&log, "", None))?;

// BAD - trailing \n creates blank line
output::print(progress_message("Merging...\n"))?;
```

**Avoid bullets in messages:** Use gutter formatting instead of bullet lists
(`- item`) for multi-line content. Bullets add visual noise and don't provide
the same clear separation as gutter formatting.

```rust
// BAD - bullet list in warning
let mut warning = String::from("Some git operations failed:");
for error in &errors {
    warning.push_str(&format!("\n  - {}: {}", name, msg));
}
output::print(warning_message(warning))?;

// GOOD - gutter formatting with bold branch names
let error_lines: Vec<String> = errors
    .iter()
    .map(|e| cformat!("<bold>{}</>: {}", e.name, e.msg))
    .collect();
let warning = format!(
    "Some git operations failed:\n{}",
    format_with_gutter(&error_lines.join("\n"), "", None)
);
output::print(warning_message(warning))?;
```

The gutter provides consistent visual structure. Branch names should be bolded
for emphasis. If we find cases where bullets are genuinely better than gutter
formatting, we can reconsider this policy.

## Error Message Formatting

**Single-line errors with variables are fine:**

```rust
// GOOD - single-line with path variable
.map_err(|e| format!("Failed to read {}: {}", format_path_for_display(path), e))?

// GOOD - using .context() for simple errors
std::fs::read_to_string(&path).context("Failed to read config")?
```

**Multi-line external output needs gutter formatting:**

When external commands (git, npm, LLM tools, hooks) produce multi-line stderr,
use gutter formatting:

1. **Show the command that was run** — Include the full command with arguments
   so users can debug
2. **Put multi-line output in a gutter** — Don't embed raw stderr inline in the
   message

Use the `format_error_block` helper in `src/git/error.rs` or follow its pattern:

```rust
// GOOD - command shown in header, multi-line error in gutter
✗ Commit generation command 'llm --model claude' failed
   ┃ Error: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known

// BAD - multi-line error embedded inline
✗ Commit generation command 'llm' failed: LLM command failed: Error: [Errno 8]...
```

**Implementation:** See `format_error_block()` in `src/git/error.rs` for the
pattern, and `LlmCommandFailed` variant for an example.

## Table Column Alignment

**Principle: Headers and values align consistently within each column type.**

Column alignment follows standard tabular data conventions:

1. **Text columns** (Branch, Path, Message, Commit):
   - Headers: Left-aligned
   - Values: Left-aligned

2. **Diff/numeric columns** (HEAD±, main↕, main…±, Remote⇅):
   - Headers: Right-aligned
   - Values: Right-aligned

**Why:** Right-aligning numeric data allows visual scanning by magnitude
(rightmost digits align vertically). Left-aligning text data prioritizes
readability from the start. Matching header and value alignment within each
column creates a consistent visual grid.

**Implementation:** Headers are positioned within their column width using the
same alignment strategy as their values (render.rs).

## Snapshot Testing Requirement

Every command output must have a snapshot test (`tests/integration_tests/`). See
`tests/integration_tests/remove.rs` for the standard pattern using
`setup_snapshot_settings()`, `make_snapshot_cmd()`, and `assert_cmd_snapshot!()`.

Cover success/error states, with/without data, and flag variations.
