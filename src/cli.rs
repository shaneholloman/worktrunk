This command automatically adds the appropriate integration line to your shell's config file.
It supports Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell, PowerShell, Elvish, Xonsh, and Oil.

The integration enables 'wt switch' to change directories and 'wt remove' to return to the
previous location.

MANUAL SETUP (if you prefer):

Add one line to your shell config:

Bash (~/.bashrc):
  eval "$(wt init bash)"

Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish):
  wt init fish | source

Zsh (~/.zshrc):
  eval "$(wt init zsh)"

Nushell (~/.config/nushell/env.nu):
  wt init nushell | save -f ~/.cache/wt-init.nu

Then add to ~/.config/nushell/config.nu:
  source ~/.cache/wt-init.nu

PowerShell (profile):
  wt init powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

Elvish (~/.config/elvish/rc.elv):
  eval (wt init elvish | slurp)

Xonsh (~/.xonshrc):
  execx($(wt init xonsh))

Oil Shell (~/.config/oil/oshrc):
  eval "$(wt init oil)""#)]

   uv tool install -U llm

2. Configure a model

For Claude:
   llm install llm-anthropic
   llm keys set anthropic
   # Paste your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
   llm models default claude-3.5-sonnet

For OpenAI:
   llm keys set openai
   # Paste your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3. Test it works

   llm "say hello"

4. Configure worktrunk

Add to ~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml:

   [commit-generation]
   command = "llm"

Use 'wt config init' to create the config file if it doesn't exist
Use 'wt config list' to view your current configuration

Switching to Existing Worktree:
  - If worktree exists for branch, changes directory via shell integration
  - No hooks run
  - No branch creation

Creating New Worktree (--create):
  1. Creates new branch (defaults to current default branch as base)
  2. Creates worktree in configured location (default: ../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }})
  3. Runs post-create hooks sequentially (blocking)
  4. Shows success message
  5. Spawns post-start hooks in background (non-blocking)
  6. Changes directory to new worktree via shell integration

HOOKS:

post-create (sequential, blocking):
  - Run after worktree creation, before success message
  - Typically: npm install, cargo build, setup tasks
  - Failures block the operation
  - Skip with --no-verify

post-start (parallel, background):
  - Spawned after success message shown
  - Typically: dev servers, file watchers, editors
  - Run in background, failures logged but don't block
  - Logs: .git/wt-logs/{branch}-post-start-{name}.log
  - Skip with --no-verify

EXAMPLES:

Switch to existing worktree:
  wt switch feature-branch

Create new worktree from main:
  wt switch --create new-feature

Switch to previous worktree:
  wt switch -

Create from specific base:
  wt switch --create hotfix --base production

Create and run command:
  wt switch --create docs --execute "code ."

Skip hooks during creation:
  wt switch --create temp --no-verify

SHORTCUTS:

Use '@' for current HEAD, '-' for previous, '^' for main:
  wt switch @                              # Switch to current branch's worktree
  wt switch -                              # Switch to previous worktree
  wt switch --create new-feature --base=^  # Branch from main (default)
  wt switch --create bugfix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD

Remove Current Worktree (no arguments):
  - Requires clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
  - If in worktree: removes it and switches to primary worktree
  - If in primary worktree: switches to default branch (e.g., main)
  - If already on default branch in primary: does nothing

Remove Specific Worktree (by name):
  - Requires target worktree has clean working tree
  - Removes specified worktree(s) and associated branches
  - If removing current worktree, switches to primary first
  - Can remove multiple worktrees in one command

Remove Multiple Worktrees:
  - When removing multiple, current worktree is removed last
  - Prevents deleting directory you're currently in
  - Each worktree must have clean working tree

CLEANUP:

When removing a worktree (by default):
  1. Validates worktree has no uncommitted changes
  2. Changes directory (if removing current worktree)
  3. Spawns background removal process (non-blocking)
     - Directory deletion happens in background
     - Git worktree metadata removed in background
     - Branch deletion in background (uses git branch -d, safe delete)
     - Logs: .git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log
  4. Returns immediately so you can continue working
     - Use --no-background for foreground removal (blocking)

EXAMPLES:

Remove current worktree and branch:
  wt remove

Remove specific worktree and branch:
  wt remove feature-branch

Remove worktree but keep branch:
  wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch

Remove multiple worktrees:
  wt remove old-feature another-branch

  wt remove --no-background feature-branch

Switch to default in primary:
  wt remove  # (when already in primary worktree)"#)]

LIFECYCLE

The merge operation follows a strict order designed for fail-fast execution:

1. Validate branches
   Verifies current branch exists (not detached HEAD) and determines target branch
   (defaults to repository's default branch).

2. Auto-commit uncommitted changes
   If working tree has uncommitted changes, stages all changes (git add -A) and commits
   with LLM-generated message.

3. Squash commits (default)
   By default, counts commits since merge base with target branch. When multiple
   commits exist, squashes them into one with LLM-generated message. Skip squashing
   with --no-squash.

4. Rebase onto target
   Rebases current branch onto target branch. Detects conflicts and aborts if found.
   This fails fast before running expensive checks.

5. Run pre-merge commands
   Runs commands from project config's [pre-merge-command] after rebase completes.
   These receive {{ target }} placeholder for the target branch. Commands run sequentially
   and any failure aborts the merge immediately. Skip with --no-verify.

6. Push to target
   Fast-forward pushes to target branch. Rejects non-fast-forward pushes (ensures
   linear history). Temporarily stashes non-conflicting local edits in the target
   worktree so they don't block the push, then restores them after success.

7. Clean up worktree and branch
   Removes current worktree, deletes the branch, and switches primary worktree to target
   branch if needed. Skip removal with --no-remove.

EXAMPLES

  wt merge

  wt merge --no-squash

Keep worktree after merging:
  wt merge --no-remove
