This command automatically adds the appropriate integration line to your shell's config file.
It supports Bash, Zsh, Fish, Nushell, PowerShell, Elvish, Xonsh, and Oil.

The integration enables 'wt switch' to change directories and 'wt remove' to return to the
previous location.

MANUAL SETUP (if you prefer):

Add one line to your shell config:

Bash (~/.bashrc):
  eval "$(wt init bash)"

Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish):
  wt init fish | source

Zsh (~/.zshrc):
  eval "$(wt init zsh)"

Nushell (~/.config/nushell/env.nu):
  wt init nushell | save -f ~/.cache/wt-init.nu

Then add to ~/.config/nushell/config.nu:
  source ~/.cache/wt-init.nu

PowerShell (profile):
  wt init powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

Elvish (~/.config/elvish/rc.elv):
  eval (wt init elvish | slurp)

Xonsh (~/.xonshrc):
  execx($(wt init xonsh))

Oil Shell (~/.config/oil/oshrc):
  eval "$(wt init oil)""#)]

Displays worktrees in a table format with status information, commit details, and optional branch listings.

- **By default:** Shows only worktrees
- **With `--branches`:** Includes branches without worktrees
- **With `--full`:** Adds CI status, conflict detection, and detailed diffs
- **With `--format=json`:** Outputs structured JSON for scripting

## COLUMNS

- **Branch:** Branch name
- **Status:** Quick status symbols (see STATUS SYMBOLS below)
- **HEAD±:** Uncommitted changes vs HEAD (+added -deleted lines, staged + unstaged)
- **main↕:** Commit count ahead↑/behind↓ relative to main (commits in HEAD vs main)
- **main…±** (`--full`): Line diffs in commits ahead of main (+added -deleted)
- **Path:** Worktree directory location
- **Remote⇅:** Commits ahead↑/behind↓ relative to tracking branch (e.g. `origin/branch`)
- **CI** (`--full`): CI pipeline status (tries PR/MR checks first, falls back to branch workflows)
  - `●` **passed** (green) - All checks passed
  - `●` **running** (blue) - Checks in progress
  - `●` **failed** (red) - Checks failed
  - `●` **conflicts** (yellow) - Merge conflicts with base
  - `●` **no-ci** (gray) - PR/MR or workflow found but no checks configured
  - (blank) - No PR/MR or workflow found, or `gh`/`glab` CLI unavailable
  - (dimmed) - Stale: unpushed local changes differ from PR/MR head
- **Commit:** Short commit hash (8 chars)
- **Age:** Time since last commit (relative)
- **Message:** Last commit message (truncated)

## STATUS SYMBOLS

Order: `?!+»✘ ✖⚠≡∅ ↻⋈ ↑↓↕ ⇡⇣⇅ ⎇⌫⊠`

- `?` Untracked files present
- `!` Modified files (unstaged changes)
- `+` Staged files (ready to commit)
- `»` Renamed files
- `✘` Deleted files
- `✖` **Merge conflicts** - unresolved conflicts in working tree (fix before continuing)
- `⚠` **Would conflict** - merging into main would fail
- `≡` Working tree matches main (identical contents, regardless of commit history)
- `∅` No commits (no commits ahead AND no uncommitted changes)
- `↻` Rebase in progress
- `⋈` Merge in progress
- `↑` Ahead of main branch
- `↓` Behind main branch
- `↕` Diverged (both ahead and behind main)
- `⇡` Ahead of remote tracking branch
- `⇣` Behind remote tracking branch
- `⇅` Diverged (both ahead and behind remote)
- `⎇` Branch indicator (shown for branches without worktrees)
- `⌫` Prunable worktree (directory missing, can be pruned)
- `⊠` Locked worktree (protected from auto-removal)

*Rows are dimmed when no unique work (≡ matches main OR ∅ no commits).*

## JSON OUTPUT

Use `--format=json` for structured data. Each object contains two status maps:

**`status` (variant names for querying):**
- `branch_state`: \"\" | \"Conflicts\" | \"MergeTreeConflicts\" | \"MatchesMain\" | \"NoCommits\"
- `git_operation`: \"\" | \"Rebase\" | \"Merge\"
- `worktree_attrs`: object (worktrees only) with:
  - `locked`: null | \"reason string\"
  - `prunable`: null | \"reason string\"
- `main_divergence`: \"\" | \"Ahead\" | \"Behind\" | \"Diverged\"
- `upstream_divergence`: \"\" | \"Ahead\" | \"Behind\" | \"Diverged\"
- `working_tree`: object with booleans
  - `untracked`: boolean - untracked files present
  - `modified`: boolean - unstaged changes
  - `staged`: boolean - staged changes
  - `renamed`: boolean - renamed files
  - `deleted`: boolean - deleted files
- `user_status`: string (optional) - custom status from git config

**`status_symbols` (display symbols for rendering):**
- `branch_state`: \"\" | \"✖\" | \"⚠\" | \"≡\" | \"∅\"
- `git_operation`: \"\" | \"↻\" | \"⋈\"
- `worktree_attrs`: \"⎇\" (branch) | \"⌫\" (prunable) | \"⊠\" (locked) | \"\"

    #[command(after_long_help = r#"## OPERATION

**Switching to Existing Worktree:**
- If worktree exists for branch, changes directory via shell integration
- No hooks run
- No branch creation

**Creating New Worktree** (`--create`):
1. Creates new branch (defaults to current default branch as base)
2. Creates worktree in configured location (default: `../{{ main_worktree }}.{{ branch }}`)
3. Runs post-create hooks sequentially (blocking)
4. Shows success message
5. Spawns post-start hooks in background (non-blocking)
6. Changes directory to new worktree via shell integration

## HOOKS

**post-create** (sequential, blocking):
- Run after worktree creation, before success message
- Typically: `npm install`, `cargo build`, setup tasks
- Failures block the operation
- Skip with `--no-verify`

**post-start** (parallel, background):
- Spawned after success message shown
- Typically: dev servers, file watchers, editors
- Run in background, failures logged but don't block
- Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-post-start-{name}.log`
- Skip with `--no-verify`

## EXAMPLES

Switch to existing worktree:
```
wt switch feature-branch
```

Create new worktree from main:
```
wt switch --create new-feature
```

Switch to previous worktree:
```
wt switch -
```

Create from specific base:
```
wt switch --create hotfix --base production
```

Create and run command:
```
wt switch --create docs --execute "code ."
```

Skip hooks during creation:
```
wt switch --create temp --no-verify
```

## SHORTCUTS

Use `@` for current HEAD, `-` for previous, `^` for main:
```
wt switch @                              # Switch to current branch's worktree
wt switch -                              # Switch to previous worktree
wt switch --create new-feature --base=^  # Branch from main (default)
wt switch --create bugfix --base=@       # Branch from current HEAD
wt remove @                              # Remove current worktree

        verify: bool,
    },

    /// Remove worktree and branch
    #[command(after_long_help = r#"## OPERATION

**Remove Current Worktree** (no arguments):
- Requires clean working tree (no uncommitted changes)
- If in worktree: removes it and switches to main worktree
- If in main worktree: switches to default branch (e.g., `main`)
- If already on default branch in main: does nothing

**Remove Specific Worktree** (by name):
- Requires target worktree has clean working tree
- Removes specified worktree(s) and associated branches
- If removing current worktree, switches to main first
- Can remove multiple worktrees in one command

**Remove Multiple Worktrees:**
- When removing multiple, current worktree is removed last
- Prevents deleting directory you're currently in
- Each worktree must have clean working tree

**Removal Process** (by default):
1. **Validates** worktree has no uncommitted changes
2. **Changes directory** (if removing current worktree)
3. **Spawns background removal process** (non-blocking)
   - Directory deletion happens in background
   - Git worktree metadata removed in background
   - Branch deletion in background (uses `git branch -d`, safe delete)
   - Logs: `.git/wt-logs/{branch}-remove.log`
4. **Returns immediately** so you can continue working
   - Use `--no-background` for foreground removal (blocking)

## EXAMPLES

Remove current worktree and branch:
```
wt remove
```

Remove specific worktree and branch:
```
wt remove feature-branch
```

Remove worktree but keep branch:
```
wt remove --no-delete-branch feature-branch
```

Remove multiple worktrees:
```
wt remove old-feature another-branch
```

Remove in foreground (blocking):
```
wt remove --no-background feature-branch
```

Switch to default in main:
```
wt remove  # (when already in main worktree)
```"#)]
    Remove {
        /// Worktree or branch (@ for current)
        #[arg(add = crate::completion::worktree_branch_completer())]
        worktrees: Vec<String>,

        /// Keep branch after removal
        #[arg(long = "no-delete-branch", action = clap::ArgAction::SetFalse, default_value_t = true)]
        delete_branch: bool,

        /// Delete unmerged branches
        #[arg(short = 'D', long = "force-delete")]
        force_delete: bool,

        background: bool,
    },

    /// Merge worktree into target branch
    #[command(long_about = r#"Merge worktree into target branch

## OPERATION

The merge operation follows a strict order designed for **fail-fast execution**:

1. **Validate branches**
   Verifies current branch exists (not detached HEAD) and determines target branch
   (defaults to repository's default branch).

2. **Auto-commit uncommitted changes**
   If working tree has uncommitted changes, stages changes and commits with LLM-generated
   message. By default stages all changes (`git add -A`). Use `--tracked-only` to stage only
   tracked files (`git add -u`).

3. **Squash commits** (default)
   By default, counts commits since merge base with target branch. When multiple
   commits exist, squashes them into one with LLM-generated message. Skip squashing
   with `--no-squash`.

   A safety backup is created before squashing if there are working tree changes.
   Recover with: `git reflog show refs/wt-backup/<branch>`

4. **Rebase onto target**
   Rebases current branch onto target branch. Detects conflicts and aborts if found.
   This fails fast before running expensive checks.

5. **Run pre-merge commands**
   Runs commands from project config's `[pre-merge-command]` after rebase completes.
   These receive `{{ target }}` placeholder for the target branch. Commands run sequentially
   and any failure aborts the merge immediately. Skip with `--no-verify`.

6. **Push to target**
   Fast-forward pushes to target branch. Rejects non-fast-forward pushes (ensures
   linear history). Temporarily stashes non-conflicting local edits in the target
   worktree so they don't block the push, then restores them after success.

7. **Clean up worktree and branch**
   Removes current worktree, deletes the branch, and switches main worktree to target
   branch if needed. Skip removal with `--no-remove`.

8. **Run post-merge commands**
   Runs commands from project config's `[post-merge-command]` in the destination worktree
   after cleanup. These receive `{{ target }}` placeholder. Commands run sequentially,
   failures are logged but don't abort. Skip with `--no-verify`.

The `--no-verify` flag skips all project hooks:
- Pre-commit hooks (before committing working tree changes)
- Pre-merge hooks (after rebase, before push)
- Post-merge hooks (after cleanup)

## EXAMPLES

Basic merge to main:
```
wt merge
```

Merge without squashing:
```
wt merge --no-squash
```

Keep worktree after merging:
```
wt merge --no-remove
```

Skip all hooks:
```
wt merge --no-verify
