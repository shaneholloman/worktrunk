    #[command(
        after_long_help = r#"Git worktrees share the repository but not untracked files. This command copies gitignored files to another worktree, eliminating cold starts.

## Setup

Add to your project config:

```toml
# .config/wt.toml
[post-create]
copy = "wt step copy-ignored"
```

All gitignored files are copied by default, as if `.worktreeinclude` contained `**`. To copy only specific patterns, create a `.worktreeinclude` file using gitignore syntax:

```gitignore
# .worktreeinclude — optional, limits what gets copied
.env
node_modules/
target/
.cache/
```

## What gets copied

Only gitignored files are copied — tracked files are never touched. If `.worktreeinclude` exists, files must match **both** `.worktreeinclude` **and** be gitignored.

## Common patterns

| Type | Patterns |
|------|----------|
| Dependencies | `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `vendor/`, `Pods/` |
| Build caches | `.cache/`, `.next/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/` |
| Generated assets | Images, ML models, binaries too large for git |
| Environment files | `.env` (if not generated per-worktree) |

## Features

- Uses copy-on-write (reflink) when available for instant, space-efficient copies
- Handles nested `.gitignore` files, global excludes, and `.git/info/exclude`
- Skips existing files (safe to re-run)
- Skips symlinks and `.git` entries

## Performance

Reflink copies share disk blocks until modified — no data is actually copied. For a 31GB `target/` directory with 110k files:

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| Full copy (`cp -R`) | 2m 5s |
| COW copy (`cp -Rc`) | ~60s |
| `wt step copy-ignored` | ~31s |

## Language-specific notes

### Rust

The `target/` directory is huge (often 1-10GB). Copying with reflink cuts first build from ~68s to ~3s by reusing compiled dependencies.

### Node.js

`node_modules/` is large but mostly static. If the project has no native dependencies, symlinks are even faster:

```toml
[post-create]
deps = "ln -sf {{ main_worktree_path }}/node_modules ."
```

### Python

Virtual environments contain absolute paths and can't be copied. Use `uv sync` instead — it's fast enough that copying isn't worth it.

Context JSON is piped to stdin for scripts that need structured data.

## Template variables

All variables are shell-escaped. See [`wt hook` template variables](@/hook.md#template-variables) for the complete list and filters.

## Examples

Check status across all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- git status --short
```

Run npm install in all worktrees:

```console
wt step for-each -- npm install
```

Use branch name in command:

```console
wt step for-each -- "echo Branch: {{ branch }}"
```

Pull updates in worktrees with upstreams (skips others):

```console
git fetch --prune && wt step for-each -- '[ "$(git rev-parse @{u} 2>/dev/null)" ] || exit 0; git pull --autostash'
```

Note: This command is experimental and may change in future versions.
