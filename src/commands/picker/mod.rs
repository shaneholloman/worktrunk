//! Interactive branch/worktree selector.
//!
//! A skim-based TUI for selecting and switching between worktrees. The picker
//! shares `super::list::collect::collect` with `wt list` — see
//! `commands/list/collect/mod.rs` for the rendering-pipeline spec — but inverts
//! the ordering because skim's `preview_window` height is baked into
//! `SkimOptions` before skim takes over the terminal, so we have
//! to estimate the visible row count up front rather than learn it from
//! collect's skeleton pass.
//!
//! # "Skeleton"
//!
//! Same meaning as in `wt list`: the column/row frame with placeholder cells
//! the user sees first. In the picker, `collect::collect` builds those rows
//! and streams them via `on_skeleton` → `PickerHandler` → `SkimItemSender` →
//! skim. (Not to be confused with the rendered skeleton-row *strings* that
//! flow through that channel.)
//!
//! # Startup flow
//!
//! On the main thread, `handle_picker`:
//!
//! 1. `current_or_recover` + config resolution.
//! 2. Reads the terminal size once; `PreviewState::new` records the
//!    Right-vs-Down layout detected from it. Every later sizing step (the
//!    estimate cap, preview dimensions, half-page scroll) reuses that snapshot.
//! 3. Allocates the `PreviewOrchestrator` and kicks off a *speculative*
//!    `git diff HEAD` for the current worktree on `COLLECT_POOL`.
//!    That bg work overlaps with everything below.
//! 4. Computes `num_items_estimate` — `list_worktrees` plus (conditionally)
//!    `local_branches` / `remote_branches`, capped at the Down layout's
//!    `max_visible_items(available)`. Only used to size skim's `preview_window`.
//! 5. Builds `SkimOptions` (immutable after this — which is why steps 1-4 have
//!    to run first).
//! 6. Spawns the `picker-collect` bg thread, which calls `collect::collect`.
//! 7. Calls `run_skim(rx)` (a thin wrapper over skim's `init`/`run` that also
//!    hands the collect handler skim's event sender for progressive repaints);
//!    skim paints the empty frame and then ingests skeleton rows from the
//!    channel as the bg thread streams them via `on_skeleton`.
//!
//! Time-to-skeleton = steps 1-6 on the main thread *plus* collect's
//! pre-skeleton phase on the bg thread. See `commands/list/collect/mod.rs`
//! § "Forks on the Critical Path" for the subprocess inventory (five
//! forks, plus one more in `extensions.worktreeConfig` repos).
//!
//! ## Phase timings
//!
//! Representative medians on the worktrunk dev repo (7 worktrees, 6 branches,
//! warm caches, release build).
//!
//! | Phase (instant-to-instant) | median | cmds |
//! |-----------------------------|-------:|-----:|
//! | `Picker started → Picker config resolved` | ~16ms | 3 |
//! | `Picker config resolved → Picker layout detected` | <1ms | 0 |
//! | `Picker layout detected → Picker estimate computed` | ~39ms | 11 (includes bg preview `git diff`s) |
//! | `Picker estimate computed → Picker skim options built` | <1ms | 0 |
//! | `Picker skim options built → Picker collect spawned` | <100µs | 0 |
//! | `Picker collect spawned → List collect started` | <100µs | 0 |
//! | `List collect started → Skeleton rendered` (bg, pre-skeleton) | ~41ms | 25 |
//! | **Time-to-skeleton** (≈ main-thread prelude + bg pre-skeleton) | **~96ms** | |
//! | `Skeleton rendered → Spawning worker thread` (post-skeleton, pre-work) | ~156ms | 86 |
//! | `Parallel execution started → All results drained` (post-skeleton work) | ~1.1s | 254 |
//! | Wall clock under `WORKTRUNK_PICKER_DRY_RUN=1` (median / p95) | ~1.4s / ~4.4s | |
//!
//! Skim's own paint cost isn't observable from the dry-run path — skim is
//! bypassed there.
//!
//! ### Reproducing
//!
//! End-to-end time-to-first-output (criterion, synthetic repo):
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo bench --bench time_to_first_output -- switch
//! ```
//!
//! Preview pre-compute workload — spawn → all preview tasks drained,
//! skim bypassed (criterion, synthetic repo):
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo bench --bench picker_preview
//! ```
//!
//! Per-phase breakdown on a specific repo (a single trace is usually enough
//! to spot where time goes; re-run a few times if you want variance):
//!
//! ```bash
//! RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/wt -C <repo> switch \
//!   2> >(cargo run -p wt-perf --release -q -- trace > trace.json)
//! # Open trace.json in Perfetto, or run the phase-duration SQL query
//! # documented in benches/CLAUDE.md §"What's on the critical path?".
//! ```
