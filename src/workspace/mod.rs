//! VCS-agnostic workspace abstraction.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Workspace`] trait that captures the operations
//! commands need, independent of the underlying VCS (git, jj, etc.).
//!
//! The git implementation is on [`Repository`](crate::git::Repository) directly.
//! The jj implementation ([`JjWorkspace`]) shells out to `jj` CLI commands.
//! Commands that need git-specific features can downcast via
//! `workspace.as_any().downcast_ref::<Repository>()`.
//!
//! Use [`detect_vcs`] to determine which VCS manages a given path.
