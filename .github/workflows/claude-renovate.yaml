            You are running as part of a weekly renovation workflow. Your job is to check for updates to CI dependencies and create PRs if updates are available.

            ## What to check

            1. **GitHub Actions runner versions**:
               - Check what the current `-latest` labels resolve to:
                 - `ubuntu-latest` - what Ubuntu version?
                 - `macos-latest` - what macOS version?
                 - `windows-latest` - what Windows version?
               - Compare against what we have pinned in our workflow files
               - Note: `windows-latest` has D: drive issues (actions/runner-images#12677), so stay on windows-2022

            2. **GitHub Actions versions**:
               - Check for updates to actions we use (actions/checkout, actions/cache, etc.)
               - Look at the current versions in .github/workflows/*.yaml
               - Check if newer versions are available

            3. **Rust nightly version** (in check-unused-dependencies job):
               - We pin a specific nightly for cargo-udeps (check the actual version in ci.yaml)
               - Periodically update to a recent nightly that works with cargo-udeps

            ## How to check

            - Use `gh api` and web searches to find current versions
            - Read our workflow files to see what we currently use
            - Check the actions/runner-images repository for runner version info
            - Check individual action repos for version updates

            ## If updates are available

            1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b chore/renovate-$(date +%Y%m%d)`
            2. Make the updates to workflow files
            3. Commit with a clear message explaining what was updated
            4. Push and create a PR with:

            ```
